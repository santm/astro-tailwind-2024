**Aaj fir dil hai kuchh udaas udaas, jaane kyun ek mayusi si chhayi hai. Aaj fir palkon pe pani hai, bheer mein hoon fir kyun ye tanhai hai, jaane kyun bebas aur beychain hai dil mera...**

In simpler terms, the world around me seems to be spiraling into chaos. A restless mind grapples with the harsh reality as loved ones on the ground face the PROBLEM, an ordeal more profound than my updates received through phone calls.

On a different note, I recently stumbled upon a site that sheds light on sleep. While the positive effects of sleep are widely known, the [sleep test](http://www.sleepnet.com/sleeptest.html) revealed something unexpected.

**I exhibit symptoms of sleep apnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder.**

Curious, I took another [online test](http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_depressionscreener), and the results indicated that I **might be experiencing moderate depression.**

And with that, I choose to hit the "publish" button. It's a small act, but somehow it brings a sense of relief.
