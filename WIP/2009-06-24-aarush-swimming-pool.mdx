title: Aarush -- Swimming pool
---

During April and May, Aarush and Pamela visited the swimming pool almost daily for a few weeks. Around 10:30 each day, he would eagerly request his swimming gear and ask us to put it on for him. However, after a few weeks, we had to stop this routine as we noticed that his cough wasn't improving, and he had developed a significant sun tan. Moreover, with the recent operation, he is restricted from participating in any water sports for the next year.
