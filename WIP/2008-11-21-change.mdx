Over the last 20 months, "**change**" has been one of the most frequently used words, courtesy of the new President-elect, Obama. I admire the way he delivers speeches and chooses his words. Many reporters must be missing those malapropian phrases used in the last 8 years.

I captured this picture in February at Mumbai Airport. Personally, I was contemplating the change and transition I was going through at work and home during that time. This is a long-awaited post with a few details, but as the line from Gandhi goes, it says it all.
