This Museum is an extension of Louvre Museum-collection of objects from

Asia. Mostly the objects are from south Asia and far east Asia, if you

been to London British Museum and visited Asian sections you will feel

*deja vu*. It is located in 16th arrondissement of Paris next to Metro

Station of Iena.



We visited the same with Francois; it was only Francois who told us

about this museum. He had been here before few times. This place not

very big but takes half day at least or more depending your likes or

dislikes. As you can see from our pictures that there are Buddha which

comes from Pakistan to China. There are lots of collections from

Japan,China and Tibet which is very beautiful and hard to explain for

me. The porcelain pieces from far-east is also very beautiful and they

are quite big.
