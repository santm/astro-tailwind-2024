Life as a forced bachelor with Pamela 'n' Aarush in Durg had left me feeling burnt out from the constant demands of personal and professional responsibilities. Weekends had become a monotonous routine of sleeping and procrastinating household chores, prompting me to reach out to old friends for a change.

That change came when Sameer invited me to join him for a weekend getaway to **Nagaon**, near 'Alibag'. Without hesitation, I agreed, eager to escape the mundane and explore something new. Alibag, located south of Mumbai, is a coastal town often frequented by wealthy individuals commuting by speed boat across Mumbai harbor. It's a popular destination for Mumbaikars seeking a beachfront retreat.

Despite the lack of a formal plan for Sunday, our impromptu decision led us on a memorable adventure. Two became one when the other intended companions couldn't make it. Sameer's early morning call informed me of his departure from Thane, and soon we were on the road, aiming to reach Karnala for a quick hike before the sun became too harsh.

> Crossing Panvel, we stopped at a petrol station to buy water bottles, and Sameer decided to refuel the car. A glitch occurred as the pump attendants struggled to connect to the credit card bank. After attempting for nearly 20 minutes, we opted to pay in cash, falling short by a few rupees. With no nearby ATMs and a toll booth approaching, we reluctantly turned back to Panvel. After finding an ATM and returning to the petrol pump, we had lost more than an hour and had to cancel our plans for Karnala.

Despite this setback, our drive was enjoyable, and we reached Nagaon by 9:30 AM. While Sameer tended to the new plants, I caught up on the Sunday newspaper. Our next destination was Kashid Beach, a scenic 30 km drive south of Nagaon. The route took us past jetties, coconut trees, and the sea. Kashid Beach, though not overly crowded, had its share of nuisances, particularly horse carts leaving their mark everywhere.

After a leisurely stroll and some time spent by the shore, we headed for a simple but satisfying lunch. Returning to Nagaon, we embraced the clean, cool air and took a refreshing nap on a lazy Sunday afternoon before making our way back to Mumbai. While the day held nothing extravagant, it set the tone for more quiet, relaxing Sundays like this one, eagerly anticipated for future getaways.
