title: Skittlish Theme with Silk Icons for Wordpress
---

Trying to spruce up the [Skittlish theme of WordPress](http://journal.barleyhut.com/the-skittlish-theme-for-wordpress/) with [silk icon sets from famfamfam.com](http://www.famfamfam.com/archive/silk-icons-thats-your-lot/).

Recently, a new version of Skittlish supporting widgets was released, making it an ideal starting point. The best part is that for a few colors (red, orange, green & blue), there are icons available for tags and users (authors). However, for the rest, there are none. Since I'm not a graphic person, I'm not sure how to proceed. Any experts out there to help me? ;-) Planning to release my best by next week.
