Just stumbled upon this ad on the **BBC website** during my usual morning news scroll. The ad caught my eye, and I found myself thinking, **“Oh, this is fantastic!** Now I can kickstart my day at home with a perfect cup of coffee at the touch of a button.

For those unfamiliar with this machine or not particularly into coffee, it operates using special coffee capsules to brew your favorite cup. With a variety of flavors to choose from, I assure you, it produces some exceptional coffee.

In India, tea reigns as the preferred beverage, with many people enjoying it with lots of milk. Similarly, coffee enthusiasts often lean towards lattes instead of the bold "espresso." I confess, I'm a bit addicted and spoiled—I don't quite function at work unless I have my dose of dark coffee.

Now, let's talk about the ad. I promptly dialed the number provided and inquired about the price. To my surprise, I received a bit of a shock—it costs **10,000 INR (approx. 200 USD)** for the machine and **25 INR (50 cents US)** for the capsules. That's not a price tag I can comfortably handle to kick off my day :(
