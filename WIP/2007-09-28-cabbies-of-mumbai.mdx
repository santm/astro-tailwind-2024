# Exploring Mumbai's Iconic Black and Yellow Taxis

The iconic black and yellow metered taxis, often glorified in Bollywood movies, play a significant role in Mumbai's public transport landscape alongside auto-rickshaws, trains, and buses. While New York taxis are unmistakably yellow and London taxis are black, Mumbai's taxis proudly sport both colors, representing a piece of the city's heritage. However, their leisurely pace during peak hours and peculiar driving habits cannot go unnoticed.

## Fascinating Facts

- These metered taxis operate throughout Mumbai, serving as the primary hired transport mode since auto-rickshaws are not permitted beyond Bandra on the western line and Sion on the central line. This restriction contributes to reduced noise pollution, orderly driving, and less congestion on the city's roads.

- Despite their quaint appearance, these taxis are reasonably priced for hire. However, passengers must contend with limited legroom, basic seat comfort, low ceiling height, and minimal window space.

- The taxis operate in a shared mode, allowing a maximum of four passengers to share a ride. However, these shared rides follow fixed routes, often catering to Mumbaikars commuting between their offices and the train stations.

- An interesting tidbit: Almost 99% of these black and yellow cabs are Premier Padmini models by FIAT, which is no longer in production. Consequently, the average age of these taxis ranges from 20 to 30 years.

- In an effort to curb environmental impact, these taxis run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), a key factor in preventing fare hikes over the past few years.

- Maintenance is relatively straightforward, as these older models have fewer electronic components compared to newer cars. Each driver is intimately acquainted with their car's technical nuances.

- While the honesty of Mumbai taxi drivers may not match the standards of the past, they still fare better than their counterparts in other major Indian cities.

Despite the enduring charm of these traditional taxis, there is a shift towards modernization. Air-conditioned taxis equipped with GPS, cordless phones, and electronic meters with printers are slowly making their way onto the streets. However, this luxury comes at a slightly higher cost than the traditional black and yellow counterparts.

Interestingly, one cab company has taken a progressive step by introducing female drivers, primarily catering to female passengers. This unique service is set to commence this November, adding a new dimension to Mumbai's taxi landscape.
