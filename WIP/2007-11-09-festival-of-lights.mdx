title: Festival of lights
---

Today, as we celebrate India's grand festival of lights, symbolizing the triumph over evil after a protracted fight, homes are adorned with the radiant glow of traditional oil-based earthen or clay lamps. These luminous beacons shine brightly in every home, whether humble or grand, from the modest huts of the poor to the opulent mansions of the rich. It is a day when the power of goodness guides us from darkness to light. People of all ages partake in a royal feast, indulging in the festive delights of snacks and sweets.

For one and all we pray gift of light -  

>Wherever you travel, may a star lead you  
The wind be at your back and road rise to meet you  
Let God holds you in hollow of his hand.


Wishing you all a very happy, prosperous and safe Diwali
