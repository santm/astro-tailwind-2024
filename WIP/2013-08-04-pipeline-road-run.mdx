title: Pipeline Road Run
---

In our running group, there was a discussion about practicing hill runs in preparation for the upcoming Hyderabad run, which I'm eager to become a regular part of. Typically, the go-to destination for hill training around Bangalore is Nandi Hills, located 60 kilometers north of the city. I've run at Nandi Hills a few times before, and let me tell you, it's a grueling challenge, especially the last 3 kilometers. The Nandi run spans 15 kilometers in total, with a 7.5-kilometer uphill climb followed by the descent. However, this run doesn't quite replicate the conditions in Hyderabad, where we need to conquer three flyovers.

The Pipe-line road, situated to the south of Bangalore, running parallel to Kanakpura Road, closely resembles the terrain in Hyderabad. Our initial plan was to run 21 kilometers one way and then treat ourselves to a sumptuous breakfast at a farmhouse.

On the day of the run, we made a slight modification to the plan. Instead of the original 21 kilometers, we decided to complete 12.5 kilometers uphill and then head back down, totaling 25 kilometers. Afterward, we'd drive our cars to the farmhouse for a well-deserved breakfast. We commenced our run from KSIT Engineering College, following the pipeline road's path. Along the way, we crossed NICE Road, passed by the Ravishankar Guruji Ashram, Angana, and reached APS Engineering College, where the pipeline road intersects with Kanakpura Road. I turned back at this point to complete my 25 kilometers, while a few others continued ahead and reached the farmhouse directly. Here's the elevation graph captured by my new GARMIN watch. I'm delighted to share that I didn't stop once throughout the trail and successfully completed it!

- **Distance**: 25.40 km
- **Time**: 2:40:44
- **Avg Pace**: 6:20 min/km

It was an exhilarating experience and a fantastic way to prepare for the upcoming challenges.
