>**Flowers are the sweetest things God ever made and forgot to put a soul into.** - Henry Ward Beecher.

I don't really know why I love capturing images of flowers. Wherever I go, if they captivate me, I instinctively make them my subject.

My dad has a profound love for gardening; for him, it is the most sociable of hobbies. It's true; the very nature of one's field of activities demands an audience. No one desires flowers to blush unseen or waste their sweetness. So, every time we are at my parents' place, we are taken on a garden tour. This particular flower is one variety of the china rose, although it doesn't emanate much fragrance from my parents' garden. Currently, we are on a 10-day vacation in **Siliguri** to escape the humid heat and fast-paced life of Mumbai. As mentioned, we made a conscious effort to capture numerous flower pictures this time using my new gadget, the Canon G7 camera. I couldn't resist sharing them.
