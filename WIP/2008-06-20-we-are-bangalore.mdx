title: We are @ Bangalore

This post will be a brief one, hastily written and published within the next 8 minutes, squeezed into my demanding schedule. I want to share that we—this time accompanied by Aarush and Pamela—have safely reached our destination after traversing from the west to the central part, then east, and finally to the south of India.

While the intricate details of our extensive journey might warrant several smaller posts, the addition of Aarush, settling into a new apartment, and work commitments leave us with minimal time for extensive documentation. We eagerly anticipate meeting all our acquaintances in Bangalore soon.
