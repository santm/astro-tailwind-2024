This was complete DYI project. Theses books are not going to be touched soon.  As you see there was one unique space available to our apartment.
Now we were also left out with some ply-baords and other building materials. I decided to take up this project myself.

Only external help I took was to get the ply-boards cut according to the size from a local hardware store.
The guys where little surprised why I myself running around instead of hiring a carpenter whoc could probably finish the whole thing with better touch in just ahalf day.

At the end it was a satisfying mini project. Also another good thing about this project completed this project within a week.
