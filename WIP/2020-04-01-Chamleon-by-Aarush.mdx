#### 2020 February 22nd @ Bangalore ####  

Slippery, scaly reptilian.  
Reptile in general, sniper in nature  
eats victims for dinner.  
Hunted by poachers  
but valued by farmers.  
For eliminating pesky pestering pests  
weapon of choice is its own tongue;  
Must have marksman ship for degree.  
Could you guess the animal?  
Not a monster,  
It is a hidden **chameleon**.
