**"Shiv Jayanti"** should not be confused with **Shivratri** (Night of Lord Shiva) - marked with devotion to one of the most powerful lords in Hindu mythology. While Shiv Jayanti (Birthday) is the celebration of the birth anniversary of **Shivaji Maharaj**, who ruled the Maratha region in the 17th century, fighting against the powerful Mughal Empire of North India. He was named Shiva after the local Goddess Shivai, to whom his mother Jijabai had prayed for a son.

## Shiv Jayanti

According to the English calendar, Shivaji's birthday is on **February 19th**. However, ShivSena, the main political party of the regional party in Maharashtra, celebrates it according to Indian astronomical dates. In Mumbai, this day is celebrated with colors and festivity. A colorful procession with lezims (a traditional musical instrument) is taken around the city. The main gathering happens at Shivaji Park in Dadar in the evening. Saffron triangular flags can be seen fluttering everywhere from train stations to cabs on this day.

However, there are some downsides to this celebration for common people. If you have to travel around Dadar or need to cross the central part of this maximum city, be prepared for an evening crawl. On the main roads, as soon as you see a big speeding SUV with flags in your rear-view mirror, you need to give the right of way. The priority given to this kind of vehicle is more than to any emergency vehicle; it also signals "do not dare to touch me or stop me" to law enforcement officials. With the recent split of ShivSena, this time there were cars from both parties to show their power and dedication to Shivaji Maharaj. Not sure if Shivaji would have appreciated the same. This is one of those celebrations that have been hijacked by political parties to show who rules the city - **'Asli Bhai Kaun Hai'**.
