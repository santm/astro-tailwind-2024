## Mid March -- Mid April, 2008



Now, Aarush started to twitch, smile, frown, and stretch a lot after waking from sleep. Amazingly (I never knew this), and apparently, babies between three to four months are at the stage where they get very playful, and drinking milk is not a priority anymore, I believe. They prefer to talk and coo to adults, being very observant at this stage, and they are attracted to moving objects, colors, and everything new around them. So was our little one.

It was not even a month's stay at Durg; on April 8th, Santanu came to meet Aarush for 3-4 days. Before leaving from Mumbai, Santanu warned me not to pamper him much by taking him in arms all the time, but later I found... on hearing one shrill cry, he used to run to him.

Aarush now started cooing in response to the gentle, soothing words of his didu. Keeps his fist in his mouth most of the time and drools sometimes. Enjoys holding his toys for a short period of time. Turns his head towards sounds. Rattles, bright pictures used to attract him. His Mesho (maternal uncle) came to meet him unexpectedly. Now he started liking to be held upright.

By now, he can lift up his head and hold it up quite steadily for quite a while. He smiles when we tickle or touch his cheeks, and his cooing just melts our hearts away! He captures the hearts of every person who comes to meet him. Now, lots of visitors come to meet him.

Sometimes he used to blow bubbles a lot. Nanu and didu were very happy with his stay at their place. Every morning, nanu used to spend quality time with him. Every hour or so, his nanu used to come to see and talk to him. My dad is not at all trained with baby care, but then he also used to carry him with nervous hands, and Aarush never used to do any mischief with him. Thrice he put his grandson to sleep when I and my mom were busy with work. So, were the days at our end.
