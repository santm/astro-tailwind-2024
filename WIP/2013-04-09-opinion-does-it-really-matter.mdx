## Opinions in the Age of Social Media

**Opinion** – a seemingly simple word, yet one that everyone possesses. Thanks to the rise of new social media platforms, expressing opinions has become incredibly easy. People share their views, labeling them as "personal" (I've been guilty of this too). But does the act of expressing an opinion truly make it personal? I'm no social science expert, but I've come across some opinions in recent times that left me wondering how to react. Initially, I engaged in arguments, but eventually, I chose to ignore them all. Perhaps you'll do the same, or maybe you'd like to share your thoughts in the comments below.

### Scene-1: Mr. President's Visit to California

Mr. President visits California and ends up apologizing for a comment that, while sounding natural, didn't sit well with the media. Sorry, Mr. President, it was a wrong choice of words, especially considering the high expectations everyone has of you. If it were your predecessor, maybe we wouldn't have seen it on the opinion pages of newspapers.

### Scene-2: Chief Minister's Role in IPL

One Chief Minister of India decides which countries are allowed to play in an Indian state for the IPL. She isn't the first to do this; a similar scenario unfolded in Mumbai a long time ago. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to have a significant impact on cricket, and everyone seems content with IPL Season Six.

### Scene-3: A Minister's Comment on Drought

There was a recent comment by an Indian minister regarding drought. I'll skip this one and save myself from typing further.

### Scene-4: Opinions on Facebook

Facebook is filled with opinions, ranging from Aloe-Vera to politics, economy, technology, history, and much more. Just like in the top three examples, I can choose to ignore them, comment, or simply hit the humble 'like' button. I often wonder why there isn't a 'dislike' button. Maybe it's more about "gamification" than "engagement."

### Scene-5: Prejudices at a Recent Party

At a recent party, I overheard people refusing to fly on an airline based on its country of origin. Does that really make sense?

In today's interconnected world, these very same individuals likely avail themselves of other products and services from that same country, either directly or indirectly. Just for the record, I remained silent – a choice made under the influence, but a wise one nonetheless.

As I reflect on this in the digital and social context, I realize that here I am expressing my opinion without launching into a heated argument, truly embracing the essence of social media discourse.
