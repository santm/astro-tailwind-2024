This marks our fourth move in the past eight years, and with each relocation, I've encountered a different set of circumstances. Today, I find myself lost in a mysterious maze of thoughts, desperately trying to capture and preserve them before they fade away, leaving behind nothing but an empty void.

I arrived at Tata Sherwood when my son was a mere 5 months old, and now he's almost three years old. In this span of time, I've had the privilege of meeting countless people and creating wonderful memories. Some became close friends, while with others, I shared enough experiences to develop a warm, amicable relationship that transcended age groups and cultural boundaries.

I vividly recall the day we moved into this apartment. As we strolled along the pavement, Santanu remarked that I wasn't particularly social and needed to reach out to people rather than confining myself at home. And now, he suggests that I stay here with my friends, while he and Aarush move to Hebbal. Navigating through this sea of nostalgia, sentimental debates, and a barrage of "ifs" and "buts," I was given the option to sell this property. However, I couldn't agree with the notion, hoping that one day it might appreciate in value. After all, they say, "Home is where the heart is," and for me, my heart still resides at Sherwood, with the friends I've made over the years.

The decision to move took time, which may sound unusual in a world where people are eager to move into their own homes. However, the medium through which I connected with people here was my son, Aarush. I often organized small gatherings, be it a snack party, potluck dinner, or a simple get-together. It was my attempt to meet both working and non-working mothers. With each gathering, there was always the addition of one or two new faces. Sometimes, there were friends with whom I didn't see eye to eye on certain topics, but that never deterred us from continuing to meet. Through these interactions, I learned a great deal, both consciously and subconsciously, about human behavior and more.

In return, I can't say whether it was a burden for them or not, but they, too, extended invitations to religious ceremonies like haldi-kumkum or impromptu evening snack parties. One of our major social events revolved around the kids' birthday parties, which seemed to occur almost every month. These gatherings brought forth the anticipation of receiving return gifts, even before the birthday presents were handed out. The cake-cutting ceremonies were always filled with boundless enthusiasm.

In a beautiful twist of irony, I combined my housewarming event with a farewell gathering, divided into two or three sets. It was my way of offering tokens of remembrance to everyone I had known, all while bidding them farewell within the same community. As it was practically impossible for me to visit each and every home for a dinner or lunch.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Kalpana, Kanchan, Pragati, Harshu, and Anita. Last but certainly not least, a special thank you to Neeti, who, despite her busy schedule, orchestrated an unforgettable dinner. To all my acquaintances and friends, I will always cherish the memories we created together, and I hope to continue coming back to Sherwood, whether you have the chance to visit me in my new place or not.
