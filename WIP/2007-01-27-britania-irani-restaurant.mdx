**Ballard Estate** stands as an old corporate park in Mumbai, adorned with buildings boasting high ceilings and windows that echo the remnants of the British Raj. I consider myself fortunate to work on this street, offering me a bird's eye view of Mumbai from my desk.

During lunchtime, I have often strolled past Britannia, an iconic **Irani (Persian)** restaurant nestled in Ballard Estate. Despite this, I had never ventured inside until recently. This 90-year-old establishment is a no-nonsense, no-frills haven—a relic from an era when such eateries adorned every corner of South Mumbai. The ambiance is straightforward, prioritizing functionality over extras like presentation and ambiance. Their motto, boldly stated on the menu, is simple yet profound: **"There is no love greater than the love of eating."** True to their word, the menu promises food within 10 minutes of ordering, a commitment they diligently uphold. A must-visit, especially for non-vegetarians, and with a unique menu for each day of the week, it adds a legendary touch to the city's culinary landscape. Notably, the building itself was designed by George Wittet, the architect behind the Gateway and the Museum.

Luck favored me on my visit as they were serving **Berry Pulao** that day—an exceptional specialty. This dish, a variation of the Iranian zereshk polow, features succulent spiced boneless mutton (or chicken), fragrant long-grain basmati rice, and tart barberries imported from Iran. While rich and hearty, it's an indulgence worth savoring, even if only on occasion.
