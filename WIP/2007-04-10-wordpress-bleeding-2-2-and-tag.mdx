title: Wordpress Bleeding 2.2 and TAG
---

Just upgraded to the latest beta trunk of WordPress 2.2 (bleeding) and found myself dealing with unrecoverable errors. I realized WordPress has incorporated tagging within the core, but unfortunately, the old faithful Ultimate Tag Warrior (UTW) does not work anymore :( 

It seems another bug-hunt has started, and I'm hoping for a solution for tag import from UTW. Until then, I'll have to live without tags. Sigh!
