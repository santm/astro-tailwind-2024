Another day in the world of technology! Today's entry revolves around a techie note—I upgraded the website to the latest beta release of WordPress and encountered some peculiar behavior. Initially, I shared my findings with the mailing list, but after a few minutes of research, I identified the root cause.

In the process, I noticed that WordPress was inserting \[code\]\[/code\] as extra content inside my existing \[code\]\[/code\] tags. This snippet was just one example:

\[code\]

\[/code\]

It turned out that the culprit was **"wp-include/formatting.php."** I generally use plain text mode while copy-pasting between the text editor on my PC and the WordPress Editor. The issue stems from newline characters \[code\]"\\n\\r" (newline)\[/code\], and these newlines get formatted as an extra \[code\]\[/code\]. A quick search and replace on the wp-posts table dump, followed by re-importing, swiftly resolved the problem.

On a creative note, I decided to change the header image at the top and set a more personal one. The chosen image is from HP Diary (2007), a memento from work. It seemed just right for an Indian blog, don't you think? While the change added a touch of personalization, it seems there's a minor issue with Internet Explorer (IE). IE doesn't appreciate some blank space between the top black part and the header. Oh, the joys of dealing with browser quirks!

Switching gears, I recently snapped some pictures of my new car—a compact diesel-powered vehicle that serves my commute to the railway station. The sunset provided the perfect backdrop for capturing the moment. Life moves on, techie challenges and all.
