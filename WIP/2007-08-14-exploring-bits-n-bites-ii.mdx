# Culinary Chronicles: A Buffet Extravaganza at Marina Bay Shopping Mall

Continuing from my last post, I am excited to share an unforgettable dining experience that unfolded spontaneously.

The impromptu plan led me to join my instructor, who had been graciously invited by a local Singaporean colleague for a post-work dinner at the Marina Bay Shopping Mall. The setting was a buffet with a fixed price, and the atmosphere buzzed with the vibrant energy of young individuals hailing from the Far East or North Asia. Identifying nationalities proved challenging; the diverse group appeared akin, seemingly high school or college students. Gratefully, our local guide had secured a reservation, sparing us from a lengthy queue.

Embarking on my culinary adventure, I delved into the world of seafood, daring to try **Oysters** for the first time. While it met expectations, the French notion of "fruit-de-la-mer" did not fully resonate. In this concept, excluding shrimps and prawns, raw offerings like oysters, clams, mussels, whelks, and periwinkles are celebrated. Drawing parallels, I reflected on a similar treatment of fish in Kerala, the southernmost state in India, where every fish is treated with utmost care. Being a 'Bong,' my heart remains loyal to **fresh river fish**.

The second round saw me savoring Japanese delights—**sushi and sashimi**—a personal favorite. For many, it's merely raw fish, but to me, it's a delightful ensemble when dipped in Shoyu (soy sauce), a hint of Wasabi, and accompanied by gari (thin-sliced sweet pickled ginger). Occasionally, it culminated with a touch of **sake**, a Japanese liquor.

As I relished my selections, my colleague's girlfriend ventured into the realm of Chinese beliefs with a bowl of **turtle skin soup**, believed to enhance female skin. A contemplative moment ensued, considering the impact of such beliefs on the conservation of Asian big cats.

Concluding the feast on a sweet note, I indulged in an array of delectable **desserts** that left my taste buds singing. Regrettably, I lacked the room for the tempting variety of ice creams on offer. Nevertheless, it was undeniably a great dinner, with each dish adding a unique chapter to this culinary saga.
