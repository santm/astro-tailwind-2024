### Coach Kothandapani

I've shared this sentiment many times before: my passion for an active lifestyle. It wasn't a recent discovery, but last year, I found a like-minded group and joined them. Now, I can confidently say that I exercise several times a week. This passion drives us to wake up at 4 AM, twice a week, just to reach the stadium and begin our workout promptly at 5 AM. It's undoubtedly challenging, but once we arrive and kickstart our day, we're filled with an abundance of positive energy.

  This exceptional group goes by the name of [PaceMakers](http://www.pace-makers.in/), led by Coach KC, a seasoned runner with numerous accolades. Being a part of this group feels like belonging to a large, supportive family. Yesterday, we had an incredible birthday celebration for Coach KC and also unveiled our new website to the world. If you're seeking a coach and a running group that promotes discipline and dedication, you might want to consider running with us a few times. Take a moment to explore our [website](http://www.pace-makers.in/) to learn more.
