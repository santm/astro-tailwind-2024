Aarush is having a great time in the green patch of the IIM Bangalore Campus. The color of the ball and his T-shirt coincidentally matched, and doesn't it look nice against the green background? I took Pamela and Aarush to show them the southern part of Bangalore, which I have been visiting quite often this year for academic purposes. It's a fantastic place to escape from the routine of everyday life and bring back memories of the "***Purani Jeans Aur Guitar...***" days.
