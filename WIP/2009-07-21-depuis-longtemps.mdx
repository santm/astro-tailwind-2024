In recent times, our blog has been silent. A few days ago, a newspaper mentioned that popular blogs are becoming less active as "**Twitter or Facebook**" gains popularity for communicating with readers. Many bloggers have shifted to updating about themselves on social media or micro-blogging platforms using SMS and original blog visitors. For us, nothing like that happened; we just got super busy with life.

We were thrilled that my younger brother and his wife took the effort to visit Bangalore (10-13<sup>th</sup> July), even if it was just for 3 days during their hectic one-month annual India trip. On the day they returned to Calcutta, they had a night flight to California. It was a short but enjoyable time, and I had classes throughout the week, even on Saturday. Pamela took them around to Commercial Street and Garuda Mall. We managed to spend Sunday together, going to Richie's at Frazer Town. While the place may not have great ambiance or cleanliness, the kebabs are mouthwatering, and the prices are reasonable. We've been there twice already, and each time, it's just about the food, with our eyes fixed on the plate.

The day I dropped them off at the airport, I realized it was soon going to be my turn *to travel*. I would be going to **Singapore** for a week on a business trip (26-31<sup>st</sup>).

Now, I need to clear out all those tiny to-do items that have been procrastinated for a while. On top of this, I have classes every Saturday @

. This means more subjects, exams, and more preparations.

At work, things are really hectic at times, and now I can relate to **"Organizational Structure"** and **"Organizational Behaviour"**. If you're like me and get puzzled by these terminologies, don't worryâ€”I didn't know them either before attending the B-school, but I had practiced through experience. The first one deals with the organization at large and how it behaves during changes, whether in difficult or good times. The second one is focused on each individual and groups (formal and informal) within the organization. No one can escape these aspects in the professional realm, but knowing these theories is definitely a plus.
