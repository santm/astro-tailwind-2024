## Mid February - Mid March 2008  

<Image src={pic1} alt="Aarush second month"/>

Parenthood is a **lifelong journey**. *No amount of training and preparation can ever fully prepare for it.* We are learning about our little helpless bundle, and the same is probably happening on his side. After returning from an official trip, Santanu was eager to spend more time with Aarush, as if ages had passed since he last saw him.

Aarush has now learned to squeal in delight as his arms flail about in the air above him. Cooing and soft, throaty sounds are heard from him from time to time. Sometimes, if he is in a good mood, he plays on his own for a few minutes with his arms and legs.

His tiny hands tug at our hair. Music is one of his favorites. Bright colors catch his attention. We figured out this month that he is (and still is) a **fan of ceiling fans**; he loves ceiling fans so much, no matter if they are on or off. Whenever he is moved to a new place, the first thing he tries to locate is a ceiling fan. As soon as he sees it, we switch it on, and he gives a million-dollar smile. Sometimes, while crying, if he happens to spot the fan, he giggles a bit and then resumes his crying session.

This month, he got DPT triple antigen shots, causing a slight fever. But he was not cranky; the only thing was he did not play much that evening with his hands and legs.

At first, he didn't enjoy oil massage, but he slowly started liking it. When held in a standing position, he supports his body with his legs. His neck is not yet firm; his head wobbles if not held properly. Santanu also tried his hand at giving him an evening massage, and Aarush liked it too.

While aunts and uncles rejoiced at his arrival, friends called to congratulate. His maternal aunt was so happy about his arrival that she sent a box full of clothes and essential things through courier.

After my mom left on March 9th, hubby and I went about in a daze, not quite sure how we were supposed to handle the little screaming, pooping bundle that we had. But those two days, he comported himself. After two days, we flew from Bombay to Durg without much fuss. That was his **first air travel**. Maybe Aarush was happy to be in secure hands, while I was not much interested in going to Durg, but Santanu and his mom wanted us to be there for a while.

His grandparents (my parents) were very happy to see him there. One maid was appointed for me as well as Aarush for oil massage twice a day.
