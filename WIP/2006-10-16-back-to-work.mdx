title: Back to Work
---

Well after one and half months of vacation I am back to work today.

Surprisingly, I will be still using my old e-mail (work) well it does

not mean that I am checking my work mails as I write this post. It will

take sometime for the IT guys before they transfer me electronically

from Europe to Asia. I thought it might be a good time to write

something for the blog.



There has been some progress in terms of settling in Bombay at our own

flat but there is long-long road ahead. There are few positive updates

but a long uphill battle to fight.



I hope both us are going to update the web-site in terms of photos and

posts more often from now on. There is a long list to write about as

there were events which brought smile and worries (most of the time)

often as we look at them through a western point of view.



As I write this post the power went out so all I can see around me is

glowing screens of computers. Welcome to India ;)
