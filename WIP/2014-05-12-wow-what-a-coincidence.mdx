For the upcoming [2014 TCS Bangalore10K](http://tcsworld10k.procamrunning.in/), I am participating in support of a meaningful cause. I will be lending my support to an NGO called **[ILP (India Literacy Project)](http://www.ilpnet.org/)**, an organization I became acquainted with through my running group. Additionally, I have volunteered to raise funds for ILP via [BangaloreCare](http://www.bangalorecares.in/events/tcs-world-10k-bangalore-2014/).

This represents my humble effort to raise funds for a cause that holds a special place in my heart. ILP is actively working in 17 states and 850 villages across India to make the fundamental right to education accessible to all. You can learn more about ILP and Bangalore Care by visiting their respective websites.

No contribution is too small when it comes to collective efforts. To add a personal touch to my pledge, I've embarked on a journey to grow a beard, inspired by the [Beard-a-thon](https://www.beardathon.com/), and I'll be maintaining it until race day.

Together, let's strive to achieve 100% literacy in India! You can support my fundraising efforts by clicking here: [**Fundraise Detail Bangalorecares.in**](http://www.bangalorecares.in/ngofundraise-detail/?fund=481&evt_id=6)

Upon returning from a two-week vacation in April, I was disheartened to discover that our initial email and Facebook outreach to friends and colleagues had not yielded significant funds. Undeterred, I have embarked on a renewed campaign, reaching out through various means to garner support and funding for our cause.

Fortunately, I am blessed with a wonderful network of friends and family. As of today, I have successfully raised 40,000 INR through the Bangalore Care website in the past two weeks. Additionally, I have received approximately 15,000 INR in my personal account since Bangalore Care does not accept international credit cards. I have also been collecting funds in person during my visits to Technopolis, and I plan to continue this effort until Friday, May 16th. Furthermore, I intend to apply for a Matching Gift program in the hope that the ILP will receive double the amount I've raised through a grant from Thomson Reuters at my workplace.

Reflecting on my journey, I can't help but recall the first organized run I participated in back in the USA in 2000. It was a small run organized to support the Literacy Project for India in Shoreline - Mountain View, a location close to the Google Campus. Shoreline served as my primary running course, and my participation was a natural choice. That Sunday morning, despite being my first race, remains etched in my memory. I held onto the event T-shirt as a cherished memento for a long time.

Now, after 14 years, a quick search this morning led me to a remarkable discovery - evidence of my participation in that race. The emotions that surged within me upon finding this digital footprint were overwhelming. What's even more astounding is that both of these races are linked by a shared cause â€” the NGO, ILP. It feels as if my journey in running has come full circle.
