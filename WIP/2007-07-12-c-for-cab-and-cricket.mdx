Cricket in India is not just a sport; it's a beloved pastime, a cultural phenomenon. This photo, taken during the **Cricket World Cup of 2007**, encapsulates the pervasive nature of cricket in the country. Despite not being a die-hard cricket fan myself, escaping cricket's influence in India is a futile endeavor.

Recent performances by the Indian cricket team might have been disappointing, but the fervor among Indians for cricket remains unchanged, whether at home or abroad. India's success in other sports pales in comparison, considering its vast population.

Cricket and cricketers enjoy an elevated status in India, with the sport being a constant topic of discussion. The peak of Indian cricket on the world stage was nearly two decades ago, a time when glamour and money didn't overshadow the game. Back then, the focus was on playing cricket rather than on endorsing brands or products.

However, the shadow over Indian cricket is cast by its cricket board, often criticized as one of the most profit-driven sports bodies globally. Filled with politicians and former cricketers, the Indian Cricket Board's insatiable appetite for money, power, and the limelight is a contentious issue. This rant concludes on a note of indifference toward something that, despite its prevalence, doesn't personally matter much.
