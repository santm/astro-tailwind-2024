title: Got G(oogle)-Phone
---

I recently downloaded the **G-Phone** application from [Google](http://mobile.google.com/) on my Blackberry. All I needed was a data-enabled phone to install **G-Phone**. Speculation had been rampant on various websites about a new hardware release from Google. Now, let's explore how these applications (Gmail, Google Maps, Google News, Google Search, GTalk, Google Calendar) perform on a standard phone, where the display isn't as large as a Blackberry, and you don't have a full keyboard or trackwheel.

If you've already tried using these applications on a phone with a smaller display and different input methods, I'd love to hear your feedback!
