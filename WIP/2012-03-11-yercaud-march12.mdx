Yercaud, often referred to as the "poor man's Ooty," is a hidden gem in South India. A recent article in [52 Weekends Gateway](http://traveller.outlookindia.com/ "Guidebook 52 Weekend Breaks from Bangalore") described it as an excellent choice compared to Ooty. In 2011, we had plans to visit Yercaud in September, right after an enchanting vacation in [Munnar](http://blog.santm.com/2011/08/30/munnar-in-monsoon/ "munnar-in-monsoon") and just before heading to Gujarat. However, the prospect of extensive traveling in such a short time led us to cancel our Yercaud booking. I've always been a firm believer in Tagore's wisdom, "good things in life need to be savored, or they will become mediocre."

After a brief interlude at [Anandhama](blog/2012-03-04-anandhadam/ "anandhadam"), we decided to give Yercaud another shot. It promised a perfect getaway with just the right amount of driving to escape the scorching Bangalore heat. This time, we opted to keep everything last-minute, including the hotel booking. On the big day, we left our basement parking at 5 AM to avoid the chaotic Bangalore traffic. Navigating through the maze of traffic was no one's idea of fun, and we yearned for an escape.

A quick stop after crossing the Tamil Nadu border for refueling revealed a sudden issue with the fuel tank release. After a bit of tinkering with screwdrivers, we managed to open it, saving us from a potential 9 to 10-hour wait for a mechanic. As usual, we halted at A2B before Krishnagiri for breakfast. We then headed towards Salem, where we began our ascent to Yercaud. The 32-kilometer journey featured numerous twists and turns, including 20 sharp hairpin bends, which made for a thrilling drive. Our initial choice for accommodation, GRT, came with a price tag that exceeded our budget, much to our disappointment. The previous night, the online rates had shown a more enticing discount. Perhaps these offers were reserved for the last-minute arrivals as the day drew to a close. We then tried Shevaroys Resort near the lake and decided to spend the night there. This landmark resort in Yercaud offered decent accommodation, but I'd recommend checking online rates before making your decision.

Our plan was to visit the famous Botanical Garden, but to our surprise, it was closed for the weekend. It was indeed an odd decision to keep a top tourist destination closed during the weekend, as if they didn't want any visitors. So, we redirected our journey towards Servarayan Temple and Cauvery Point road, with Aarush asleep in the backseat. Our first stop was Pagoda Point, offering a captivating view of the plains below. We then proceeded to Lady's Seat and Gent's Seat, providing an aerial view of the ghat road that brought us to Yercaud. Next to this was the Horticulture Farm, featuring a rose garden. Unfortunately, there were no roses in sight, as they had just been freshly trimmed. We contented ourselves with the other lush greenery around.

Returning to our hotel around 3:00 PM, we enjoyed a late lunch, and Aarush had woken up by then. After lunch, we explored a small plantation within the resort, where Aarush had some fun in the children's play area. Finally, we retreated to our room for a quick refresh, followed by an early dinner.

The next day, we began with a morning walk around the lake before breakfast. Post-breakfast, we visited the renowned Montfort School, originally established for Anglo-Indians during World War I. The school's architecture and the natural beauty surrounding it made the visit worthwhile. It's one of the leading convent residential institutions in South India. On the day of our visit, the school was conducting admissions tests, and we could only spot expensive cars and anxious, impeccably dressed parents.

Afterward, we headed back to Bangalore, making a stop at A2B just after crossing Dharmapuri for lunch. Aaursh was very sleepy but played the role of a cranky child throughout the journey. After reaching Hosur, we managed to coax him into a nap, ensuring a safe return home within the next hour.

The NH7 highway was excellent, complete with numerous toll plazas that seemed intent on emptying our wallets. Whether Yercaud qualifies as the best hill station or not remains open to interpretation, but it certainly didn't feel as crowded as Coorg.
