At approximately 10 AM, we set out on our journey to Kottayam, a distance of around 140 kilometers from Varkala. Initially, we followed the road signs for Kochi, but as we approached Kottayam and Kumarakom, we briefly lost our way. However, it didn't take us long to find our path to Kottayam. The roads were generally in good condition, except for the final stretch leading to GK Riverview Homestay, a place recommended by the Rough Guide. The homestay owner had initially expressed concerns about hosting us with a small child, but this challenge only strengthened our determination. We had reservations to stay at GK Riverview for two nights.

**GK Riverview Homestay** is nestled along the banks of the Meenachil River in Aymanam. The house is located right in front of a backwater canal, offering the opportunity for a tranquil ride on traditional country boats while observing the local way of life. With only four rooms, this homestay provides stunning views of the surrounding paddy fields and offers hammocks and swings for a relaxing stay. It's the perfect choice if you prefer a television-free environment, crave a close connection with nature, and seek an escape from the urban hustle and bustle. During our stay, we had the pleasure of spotting numerous bird species.

Upon our arrival, it was late in the afternoon, and we were quite hungry. The gracious hosts offered us sandwiches, knowing that we planned to have an early dinner. Later that evening, we were treated to a traditional Keralite home-cooked meal, which we enjoyed alongside other guests, many of whom were foreigners. While dining, we discussed our plans for the following day with our host, who kindly presented us with various options.



## Exploring backwater all day

The next morning, our host walked with us and accompanied us to the ferry junction, from where we embarked on a boat ride on the vast Vembanad Lake, accompanied by local residents. Subsequently, we headed to Alappuzha (Alleppey) to rent a houseboat, enjoying a delightful two-hour cruise on the lake with its captivating scenery. Throughout the journey, we encountered a multitude of birds and houseboats, and witnessed the everyday life of village residents. During a brief stop for tender coconut refreshments, we encountered a pet Brahminy kite (as seen in the photo with Aarush). Aarush was able to hold the bird easily due to its injury. Afterward, we enjoyed a delicious lunch in Alleppey.

We returned to the Kottayam railway station by taking another local ferry, where an auto was waiting to transport us back to the homestay, courtesy of GK Riverview.

Considering the high prices for houseboat stays in December, we opted not to spend the night on one. Nevertheless, we indulged in boat rides throughout the day, totaling approximately 6 to 7 hours on boats. Traveling on public boats provided us with a genuine glimpse of everyday life, from schoolchildren commuting to people returning from town with their daily provisions.

After a satisfying dinner, we retired early to ensure an early departure the next day. Every meal provided by GK was excellent, solidifying their reputation as exceptional hosts.
