After relocating from Paris, our long-standing plan to explore destinations beyond Mumbai was finally realized. Armed with a travel book on India, we intended to discover more about our homeland. However, due to various circumstances, our plans remained on hold. It wasn't until the recent weekend that Santanu unexpectedly discovered he had a holiday on **Maha Shivratri**, prompting us to make a spontaneous one-night trip.

Harihareshwar, a small town with a palm-lined beach, is renowned for the Kalbhairav (Shiva) temple and the ideal beach resort managed by MTDC. The beach, characterized by its black sand from rocky shores, captivates with its serenity, far removed from the bustling city, and its uncommercialized charm, unlike more touristy destinations like Goa or Kovalam. The beach divides into two parts: north and south.

The southern beach, home to the resort facing the sea, offers rooms, tents, and cottages in a bamboo grove with AC. Unfortunately, due to the impromptu nature of our plan, we had to settle for a night at the "Geetanjali rest house" as paying guests for a modest 400 Rs. per night. Meals were enjoyed at the MTDC canteen, where the view of the sea through the greenery offered a refreshing sight. Chairs were arranged under a thatched roof, allowing us to dine under a starlit sky with a sweeping view of the bay and lit-up boats on the sea. This side of the beach was notably less crowded than the northern part. Though the hosts kindly offered us "gharguthis," a coastal-flavored Konkani meal, we declined as they were fasting for Shivratri.

The northern side houses the temple and provides a breathtaking view of the sunset. Lounging there, witnessing the red ball of the sun plunge into the roaring Arabian Ocean, accompanied by the sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore, is an experience beyond words.

The next day, an early start took us to Shrivardhan, 15 km away, famous for its beach, temple, and historic monuments. Despite being the hometown and birthplace of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, the beach didn't match the allure or maintenance of Harihareshwar.

The drive on NH-17, with the exception of bumpy roads from Mangaon to Mhasla, was delightful. It was a short stay but one that will be etched in our memories. Importantly, this was Santanu's first time driving 170 km from Kharghar for a continuous 4 1/2 hours. During our return journey, we made a pit stop near Mangaon to procure fresh veggies and brunch (Resort Open Umbrella).

In the end, Santanu regretted not having learned stick-shift earlier, which might have allowed us to explore even more of France.
