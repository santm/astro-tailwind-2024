Here's another glimpse of Mumbai's Ballard Pier from my desk. Perhaps, I find myself engrossed in meetings, leaving little time for romantic endeavors with my valentine. Heart-shaped balloons gracefully drift around our office, serving as gentle reminders of this special day. Unfortunately, due to a series of meetings and a tight schedule, I even missed out on the chocolate distribution. **C'est dommage!!!** :( 

Despite the immense work pressure, various thoughts are crossing my mind, each aimed at making the evening more delightful. Let's see if these plans materialize or not.
