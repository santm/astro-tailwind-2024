Apologies for the lack of recent posts; we're still connected to the internet but finding the time to spare for updates has been a challenge. There are a few overdue posts waiting in the pipeline. Our best typing moments come when Aarush is peacefully asleep, but at that point, exhaustion tends to set in, and we retire quickly.

No need to worry; we plan to post more frequently as we strive to establish a stricter routine. On a side note, I recently registered on Facebook after much contemplation. As Eric aptly remarked:

> "Viva Santanu! Viva Pamela! And viva the little Misra! Welcome to this simultaneously silly and essential place called Facebook..."

In other news, I've just upgraded all the plugins and WordPress to the latest versions, prompted by the dashboard indicating the urgency of completing this task.

Stay tuned for more updates!
