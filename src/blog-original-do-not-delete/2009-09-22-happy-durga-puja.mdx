Hello everyone, happy festivity! It is a time of celebration in India, especially in the north and east, where it is Navaratri in the North and Durga Puja in the East. Pamela and Arush left on Sunday for Durg. It will be almost 8 years since Pamela celebrated Durga Puja at her mother's house. For Bengalis, it is the most special occasion in the calendar. According to mythological belief, Goddess Durga is considered the daughter of every Bengali and she visits her parents with her four children.

For me, life has been very hectic at work in the last few months after coming back from Singapore. At times, I felt new heights of anxiety and pressure that I have not experienced before. In a way, it was a good learning experience, but I questioned myself: do I have enough material to lead effectively? Well, maybe I am reading too many Harvard Business Reviews. I am really looking forward to a great ending to this course now. I wish I could plan for our next vacation; since March, we haven't gone out together in Bangalore. I am already dreaming of Andaman.

I am counting the days until the upcoming camping trip that I am supposed to take in the first week of October. I got all my camping gear out of various boxes that have not seen any action in the last 5 years since I left Sunny California.

Pamela has kept [Aarush's picture website](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/) updated. She is really great as she updates it twice a week as soon as she gets a chance to sit down with the computer. But really, at times, I feel this blog space is not getting enough updates it should get. I wish we both could do the same with the blog; I should write soon after coming back from the camping trip.
