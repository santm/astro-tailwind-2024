Have a safe holi; this picture was taken on night before celebrating holi-ka-dahan at Tata-Sherwood.

After many years celebrated the sprit of holi. It is observed on the night before the main Holi celebration.

People offer symbolic items like grains, coconuts, and gram to the bonfire, seeking blessings and a fresh start.

## The mythology

Once upon a time, there was a mighty demon king, Hiranyakashipu, who wanted everyone to worship him. However, his son, Prahlad, was a devoted follower of Lord Vishnu. This angered Hiranyakashipu, who tried everything to change Prahlad's mind.

Hiranyakashipu sought help from his sister, Holika, who had a special power that made her immune to fire. They planned to trick Prahlad into a blazing fire, hoping he would burn while Holika remained unharmed.

As the fire roared, something unexpected happened. Holika's power failed her, and she was consumed by the flames, while Prahlad, protected by his unwavering faith in Lord Vishnu, emerged unscathed.

This miraculous event demonstrated the power of true faith and devotion, making Prahlad a revered saint. His story reminds us that unwavering faith can protect us from harm.
