Well after all these years of self hosting and WordPress I am kind of let go the Self-hosting. Moved
[pamela.santm.com](http://pamela.santm.com/) to Tumblr and all the pictures from Gallery3 to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/).Â   

Still need to move www.santm.com somewhere and aarush.santm,com pictures to somewhere, most likely it will be Flickr again. hope to complete the all these before 2013 finishes.


> 2023 Update: Even after a decade, the project is still a ğŸš§ work in progress. With mobile phones now serving as the primary camera and Google Photos as a backup, improvements have been made, but there's still a long journey ahead. ğŸ“±ğŸ“¸
