If you happen to be reading this post on September 17th, kindly give me a call or send an email if you haven't already.

Now, let me share why I'm writing this post. I find myself stuck on a business trip, separated from my loved ones, Pamela and Aarush, for the past three weeks. There are moments when I wish I could simply leave my current job and spend some quality time with my family. However, due to financial commitments, I don't foresee that happening anytime soon :(.

Nevertheless, I want to take a moment to extend warm wishes to Pamela on her special day!!

>*Note: If you're reading this after September 17th, your good thoughts and wishes are still greatly appreciated.*
