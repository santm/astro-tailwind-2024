I was looking for a simple instant coffee cake recipe, and after reading a few here and there, I zeroed in on this one from [NestlÃ©](http://www.tasterschoice.com/recipes/iced-coffee-bundt-cake/desserts/144734.aspx). As usual, I did not have many things at home, and being a weekend, I decided to go with whatever we had in the kitchen and make a simple sponge cake with coffee flavor. I was very surprised by how simple and tasty it came out. Being a coffee lover, I would definitely try it again ğŸ˜‡

I had a disastrous start when I mixed baking powder and baking soda into the wet mixture of butter and sugar. And in the end, I thought I would put at least a few raisins in the middle, but I forgot, as you can see in the picture on the top layer.

The best part is when things go right, they go RIGHT ğŸ˜‹. With all that, the cake came out very perfectly. I wish I had a picture from just out of the oven; these are pictures after cutting the cake.

Here is my poor man's **recipe** if you want to give it a try:

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter
- 3 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons NESCAFÃ‰ instant Coffee
- 1 cup milk (warmed the milk and added the instant coffee, then let it cool before mixing)
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla

> Please ensure the oven is preheated enough with 20-25 minutes of heating time to get the best result from the oven.
