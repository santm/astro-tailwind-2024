### 2004 June 

Time to bid **Ciao, a presto** (goodbye, see you soon) to Venice! Although we were aware that the next visit might not be soon. With cheerful spirits, we set off for Milan, where our memorable journey had commenced. Boarding the Eurostar, for which we had secured advance reservations, undoubtedly marked the pinnacle of our train experiences in the past seven days. Upon reaching Milan, we stowed our luggage in the locker room and embarked on an exploration of this business and fashion hub of Italy.

Starting with **Milanâ€™s cathedral**, the city's centerpiece and the third-largest church in Europe, proved to be a captivating visit. Adjacent to Cathedral Square, the **Galleria Vittorio Emanuele**, Milan's grand four-story-high, glass-domed arcade, beckoned as a haven for shopping enthusiasts. Regrettably, Milan's famous opera house was closed for renovation, and we decided to forgo Leonardo's "Last Supper" and his unrealized bronze horse.

Lunch unfolded in a small store where the pasta turned out to be truly ambrosial, undoubtedly a culinary delight. In the late afternoon, we meandered through prominent brand stores for clothes, and I couldn't resist purchasing a wristwatch as a personal souvenir, albeit at a dear cost.

Early in the evening, we sought out a restaurant recommended by our guidebook in the business district, only to find it surprisingly deserted on a Sunday. Nevertheless, we stumbled upon a spacious restaurant with white tablecloths, where we received warm hospitality from the owners that left an indelible impression. The service was impeccable, complemented by a delectable meal starting with pasta and culminating in a substantial fish serving. Pamela, our companion, displayed her feline preference, missing the bones and head, which they promptly cleared away. As the clock ticked away, we bid our farewell to Italy. The train to Paris awaited us after a long and strenuous day, providing a night of much-needed rest.

> **Epilogue:** Crafting this travelogue after three years posed its challenges. Various websites were consulted to ensure accuracy. Undoubtedly, it's worth reminiscing about those eight days. Immersing oneself in recollections of lazy afternoons and vigorous mornings was a gratifying experience, knowing that such breaks may not be a frequent occurrence in my current life.
