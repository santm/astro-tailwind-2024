Choosing not to entitle this post with a generic "Welcome to Bangalore" or "Here I come to Bangaluru" is intentional. I believe it will take some time before I can truly call this city my new home. The decision to move to Bangalore had been on the horizon for quite some time, but due to personal reasons, I had to delay it. Fortunately, my company was understanding and accommodating of the situation.

Finally, on Sunday, the 27th of April, I began my partial move, embarking on a journey from Mumbai to Bangalore in my car, covering a distance of 955 kilometers in 20 hours. The experiences of this road trip deserve a post of their own, and I plan to share them as soon as I find a suitable place to rent and establish some semblance of a settled life.
