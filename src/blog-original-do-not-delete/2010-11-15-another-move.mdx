In a few weeks, we will be relocating from our current address, but this time, it's just a short move within Bangalore. Compared to our previous relocations, this one is going to be a breeze. In 2003, we crossed the Atlantic, moving from California to Paris. In 2006, we ventured across the Indian Ocean, from Paris to Mumbai. Then, in 2008, we made a significant move within India, going from Mumbai to Bangalore. Now, we're making a mere 20-kilometer move within the city.

The painters from Asian Paint Home Solutions have taken on the task of giving our new space a fresh look, and they are scheduled to complete the job by the 25th of November. Our color scheme will be predominantly white, with a slight variation on one of the major walls. We hope that everything goes according to plan.

Just recently, we enjoyed a fantastic week-long break in Rajasthan during Diwali, and Pamela is diligently working on the travelogue to capture the essence of our journey. We'll be posting pictures as soon as we finish writing up all the exciting details.
