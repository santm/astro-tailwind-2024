### 2004 June 

Yesterday, as evening descended upon Florence, a gentle drizzle welcomed us, persisting through the night. Upon waking, we were greeted by a somber grey sky—a stark contrast to the picture-perfect blue skies of the past few days. Temperature drop necessitated the retrieval of light jackets. While our hotel wasn't extraordinary, its cleanliness and central location allowed us a view of the dome of the famous cathedral from our room window.

As the capital of the Italian Renaissance, Florence beckoned us to explore its renowned treasures—**Uffizi** and **Accademia dell’Arte**. We opted to begin with the latter, conveniently located next to our hotel. However, an unexpected sight greeted us at 8:00 AM—an extensive queue snaking its way towards the entrance. Undeterred by intermittent rain, patient visitors awaited their turn, even resorting to umbrellas.

Photography within the premises was strictly prohibited, with vigilant security personnel preventing any attempt to capture the artwork. Although flash photography was forbidden, the occasional flash and subdued whispers permeated the atmosphere. Amidst this, art students found discreet corners to sketch. The magnificent statue of David, celebrating its 500th birthday, stood prominently, surrounded by numerous other artistic treasures.

> **Tip:** If your primary interest lies in David and Slaves, it's worth a visit; otherwise, the entrance fee may not justify exploration.

Subsequently, we strolled to **Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral)**. The cathedral's architectural beauty, adorned with marble detailing on walls and floors, demanded careful observation to grasp the intricacies of its craftsmanship. The massive dome, an engineering marvel created without steel, loomed overhead. The renowned **“Last Judgment”** adorned the interior, albeit straining necks with its imposing presence. Adjacent to the cathedral stands **Battistero di San Giovanni**, considered the oldest building, and the “Gate of Paradise,” which inspired **Rodin’s** **“Gate of Hell.”**

Central Florence exudes vibrancy and pedestrian-friendliness, with major attractions just minutes apart on foot. **Piazza della Signoria** (a.k.a. **Palazzo Vecchio**) stands as one of the main squares, once home to the original David alongside numerous sculptures before finding its current abode.

Opting for a Renaissance walk towards **Ponte Vecchio**, we purchased advance tickets for the Uffizi museum en route. The oldest bridge over the **Arno River**, Ponte Vecchio, lined with jewelry shops, connects Uffizi to the old Medici palace.

Lunchtime led us to an unplanned yet delightful restaurant with white tablecloths. Surprisingly, the prices were reasonable compared to other tourist spots. Sampling pasta served with freshly baked bread proved to be a culinary delight.

Post-lunch, we crossed the Arno, bypassing **Piazzale Michelangelo** and other attractions such as **Boboli Gardens**. Instead, we visited the Church of **Santa Croce**, housing monumental tombs of **Galileo, Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Dante,** and more. This everyday church for locals charges a minimal fee for tourist entry, providing access to other areas within the building. The attached leather factory offers quality goods without the hassle of bargaining. The serene and lush green garden (cloister) complements the surrounding leather shops.

> **Tip:** A great place to purchase fashionable leather jackets.

A bus ride to the railway station marked our attempt to visit another renowned church, **Santa Maria Novella**, only to find it closed. This church also boasts numerous artworks. Concluding our day, we returned to the hotel, refreshed, and stumbled upon a true Italian restaurant greeting us with a warm **“Buonasera!!!”** Here, we relished Tuscan specialties in a small, tidy eatery frequented by locals. Truly, a gratifying experience worth expressing gracias.

> **Tip:** Reserving museum tickets in advance (preferably online) may be slightly costly but saves valuable time. Additionally, if you're in Paris, the Louvre Museum features plenty of Renaissance works, and on the first Sunday of each month, entrance is free.
