As we couldn't enjoy much the earlier day, we decided to opt for a rented bike and move around at our own pace. We rented a bike for 2 days for 400 Rupees. One interesting thing about Goa’s motorcycle taxis, locally known as **pilots**, is ideal for nipping between beaches or short distances. Bonafide operators ride black bikes with yellow mudguards and a white number plate. These vehicles transport a single pillion rider. 

As usual, after breakfast, we headed towards Anjuna beach. Anjuna is gorgeous with its rocky shore and mighty cliffs where you can hear techno-thumping sounds and see hippies around. With the morning sun and plenty of time at hand, we made this **[special sign](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2007/goa/beaches/goa)** to remember Goa. Vagator, however, is the perfect hideaway spot with its few beach shacks and fishing boats off in the distance. Black lava rocks, the coconut palms, the lush green landscape, nature playing its own music, and the sea turning from aquamarine to emerald green with Chapora Fort in the background. The reminiscence of the old Portuguese times gives a splendid view of the sea and hills covered with coconut trees and rice fields. To reach the middle and little Vagator, one needs to walk, *but the calmness is worth the effort as big Vagator gets busloads of Indian whiskey-drinking male tourists*.

At noon, the sun is really hard to tolerate, but for lunch, we made sure to have the exotic flavors of Goan dishes at whatever cost. So, we searched hard to find one place called **“Gabriel”** recommended by our guidebook as authentic Goan cooking. It was really worth searching.

For most Goans, three basic necessities – fish, rice & beer. Goans value their food as much as they do their daily siesta. In their daily meal, seafood always has a pride of place in some form. From fried fish to exotic concoctions; seafood is usually a must on the menu, except for the occasional break for some religious observance. Besides fresh seafood, dried and salted fish dishes are also highly prized by Goans.

We ordered **Galinha com Coentro** (chicken with fresh coriander leaves and vinegar) and prawn curry with rice. It was really fresh, home-made, and scrumptious. The owner was friendly; we had a chit-chat with him. We figured out it was a guesthouse cum restaurant with lots of shady trees around and not far from the sea. The sitting arrangement is in the garden under trees with fans. Since it was shady, we spent 2 hours there, and at last, we were offered yummy chocolate (European one after a long time).

In the evening, we prepared ourselves for soaking at Baga beach; smeared well with body oil. On day two, we found that the sand was very fine and sticks to the body like glue even after a proper shower. So, smearing oneself helps as the sand can't stick to the body and washes off with each roaring wave.

In the evening, we went to the Tibetan market right across our resort where Santanu bought one finger-ring for himself and then headed for dinner at Baga-Calangute road to one nice restaurant. Wanted to taste one Goan dessert for the last 3 days; since we were not left with an inch place in the stomach, we could not. But today made sure to eat less so that we can taste it. For dessert, the best is **Infantaria Pastelaria** recommended again by our guidebook, which was right across our resort where we bought **Bebinca** – a layered pudding.
