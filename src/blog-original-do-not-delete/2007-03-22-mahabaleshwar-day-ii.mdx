On day 2, we woke up late, took a stroll in the backyard, and then decided to walk towards the main market to book our return trip and have breakfast. On the way, we had strawberries from a street corner, as it's a very common product sold throughout the area. We booked our return bus trip and were offered a shared taxi at 175 Rs for the **Mahabaleshwar darshan**, which we accepted. We walked on the main bazaar street of Mahabaleshwar, which is full of quaint shops that are certain to catch your fancy.

It's a bit hot at noon during this time of year. We had lunch at a nearby restaurant and returned to our cottage, where Santanu had a nice time reading RD in the backyard, and I took a beauty sleep. At the appointed time, the taxi came, and we were ready to hit the exploration button, which included Kateâ€™s Point, Echo Point, Needle Hole, Venna Lake, Lodwick Point, Elephant Head, and Sunset Point.

Sunset Point, also called Bombay Point, being close to our MTDC resort, offers an expansive view of the sunset and is considered one of the most beautiful, popular, and oldest sights in Mahabaleshwar. However, it is too crowded with tourists, and people come here to ride horses and get themselves photographed with horse stunts against the backdrop of the sunset. It got its name since it was on the old road to Bombay.

The next day, we started the return trip in the morning, enjoying the journey in those semi-comfy bus chairs. Otherwise, we would have had to endure hair-raising stunts from some of the crazy drivers on those winding and hairpin-bending roads.
