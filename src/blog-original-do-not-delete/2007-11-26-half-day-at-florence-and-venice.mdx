### 2004 June 

After enjoying three nights in Florence, it was time for our onward journey. We packed our bags, checked out, and left our luggage at the hotel. A leisurely walk led us to **Palazzo Vecchio** (Piazza della Signoria), a city square adorned with timeless artworks. Florence, with its captivating beauty, has the power to hold you spellbound. In close proximity lies the renowned **Uffizi**, which we reached by 8:30 AM for our scheduled visit. The Uffizi, shaped like a long rectangle, may not be as expansive as other top European museums, but it houses famous paintings by *Leonardo, Dante, Michelangelo, and Botticelli*, making it a true Mecca for art enthusiasts.

Around mid-day, we returned to the hotel, collected our luggage, and headed to the train station for our next destination – **Venice**. A mere three-hour train ride transports you from Florence to Venice, a unique city built on small islands and crisscrossed by around *100 canals*.

Upon arrival in Venice, our first order of business was purchasing a 2-day pass for public transport. The only means of transit in this architecturally stunning city is by **boat or water taxi**. Opting to stay at **Lido** across the sea, we discovered numerous ferries connecting St. Mark's Square and Lido. At the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised when, for the first time, someone recognized my birthplace as mentioned in my passport. The on-duty manager was a Bangladeshi who sought refuge in my hometown during the 1974 war and has been residing in this romantic capital for a considerable period. After a brief chat, we immediately set off for **St. Mark's Square**, vibrant with tourists sipping drinks and being entertained by dual orchestras. It's also the place where you notice the rising tide, signaling Venice's sinking predicament.

Venice is a labyrinth of backstreets, deserted squares, and mysterious alleyways that can easily lead you astray. We wandered carelessly, exploring a few narrow lanes nearby.

Dining in the city of romance can be pricey, especially for fresh local seafood. Opting for a simple and crowded pizzeria, we were disappointed with the taste of the pizza. As we discussed our culinary experience, a mother and her teenage daughter from New Zealand joined us from the next table. Engaging in a pleasant and lengthy conversation, we learned about their winter vacation plans to Florence.

Before returning to Lido, we captured some night mode pictures of the empty St. Mark's Square with our new tripod.

>In hindsight, I perceived Venice as a colossal Disney Land. The population seems divided into two categories – tourists or those associated with tourism. Perhaps there's a vibrant and youthful side of Venice that eluded us. Unlike Rome, Milan, or Florence, where we observed local young people attending school or college and leisurely hanging out in one of the piazzas.
