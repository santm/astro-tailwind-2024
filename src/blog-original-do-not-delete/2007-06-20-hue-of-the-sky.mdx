Siliguri is the gateway to the Northeast of India, a commercial city in North Bengal where **tea, timber, and transport** are the primary businesses. It serves as a base point to head towards *Darjeeling, Sikkim, Kalimpong, Mirik*, etc. Additionally, it is a crucial **transit point** for air, road, and rail traffic to the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.

Situated at the foot of the *Eastern Himalayas*, it enjoys a very pleasant temperature, but the weather is very unpredictable, with showers occurring at any time. Summer here differs from other parts of India, avoiding scorching heat, with daytime temperatures hardly exceeding 32°C. Every 3-4 days, there's a light rain, sometimes a short, sharp downpour. Winters, on the other hand, are bitingly cold, with the mercury hardly rising to 15°C during the day. On clear winter days, it provides an excellent view of the Himalayan peaks, with an opportunity to see them as a backdrop of snow-clad mountains.

In May, we spent 10 days there, providing a great escape from Mumbai’s heat and frequent power failures. The pictures below were taken from the terrace of my in-law’s house.
