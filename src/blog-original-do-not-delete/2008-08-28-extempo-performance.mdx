Pamela's maternal cousin Jeet was our guest in Bangalore for three nights from Calcutta. His purpose for this trip was to meet his school and college mates, as most of them work in the Bangalore IT sector. Jeet plays the guitar and mouth organ as hobbies. His musical talent is in his genes; he inherited it from his mother, who is a trained singer and used to perform on All India Radio in her younger days.

Enough of the introduction! This was a very informal recording, as we noticed Aarush was enjoying his first live music. Usually, he turns his head towards the speaker when we play some music to locate the source of sounds. However, nothing comes close to a live performance, and even a little one realizes the same :D.
