*Bombay International Airport* is always under construction, at least whenever my international travels are concerned. The good news is that it is getting better, and the completion date is drawing nearer. Here are the pictures as I waited for my flight to Singapore. Though the pictures look like world-class construction work, on the ground, it may not be the same quality-wise.
