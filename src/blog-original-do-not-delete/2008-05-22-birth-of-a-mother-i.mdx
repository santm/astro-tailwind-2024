It was **11th Jan** when I went to my gynecologist in an emergency as I couldn't feel the movements. After the check-up, she mentioned that if my baby didn't arrive anytime sooner than the 15th, she would have to perform an induction. She didn't want to take any risk at this stage because of **cervical incompetence and a heart problem**. So at last, we opted for a planned c-section on **17th Jan**.

The night before, I took admission at MGM Belapur, Navi Mumbai. This time, I knew a few of the nurses and attendants quite well from my last stay at the hospital (3 months before). Those who were on night duty came to me, giving encouraging words for the next day. Most of the night, I couldn't sleep because of anxiety. Being a first-time mother, I was completely blurred on labor. On d-day very early morning, I took a preoperative shower; getting ready for this big event. From morning onwards, I was asked not to take water or food and was on **IV** until I was taken to **O.T.** It was **Thursday**, around 11 am my water bag broke; I got scared & nervous at the first thought to myself. Finally, the time has arrived for my baby to be born. Immediately my ob-gynae. was informed, and I was prepared to be taken to OT. Everyone was busy monitoring the baby's movement and heartbeat every few minutes as I laid on the bed. They wheeled me immediately to OT. Junior doctors, my gynecologist, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, physician, and pediatrics were already there in the room. They were talking among themselves as well as to me to keep my mind diverted.

They moved me from a trolley-bed to the Operation table, which was really narrow. Ceiling suspension lights were turned on. On one side, there was a table with their instruments and items such as pickups, scissors, scalpel blades, and needles, etc. Phew.. seeing them, my heartbeat raced, eyes rolled big. My gyne. was already ready in her surgical attire with gloves, caps, masks, suture sterile gown, and protective eyewear. Soon, my cardiologist along with anesthesiologist went through the report and explained what he is going to do, what would happen, and how I will feel. **VOILA!** He made me sit straight, and his juniors started preparing my back skin with antiseptic agents, and there after he administered 2 or 3 injections at the spinal cord. This was **local anesthesia** (partly conscious) compared to what I experienced before during the 6th month which was a general one. While the junior doctor helped me to lay on my back again. These injections almost paralyzed me from the bottom. As a shadowless mobile operation light was switched on, I surrendered myself to my doctor while she comforted with a nice pretty smile.

As I lie with my lower part paralyzed, hands strapped far apart. Once finished with the catheter, I requested them to blindfold me as could not take any more of those sharp instruments coming that close to my body. ***It took hardly a few minutes (10-12 min.- I suppose) for my gyne. to take out the baby from the womb.*** What I understood is stitching is a long procedure compared to that of the delivery part. “**It’s a male**” she said barely discernible over the loud crying when someone spanked his bottom. After delivering the baby, she left the room while the cardio-physician and anesthetist remain to do the rest of their job. Arrgh... God the whole process went well. Around 12.40 PM Aarush was shown to me...he was so tiny then weighing 3.5kg only. *The doctors and the attending staff were the most loving people, and I just felt very cared for and attended to.*

Here he starts his **arduous journey** to the outside world with elbows bent, hips and knees flexed, arms and legs held close to the front of the body. His nails were sharp enough to hurt one, with fine soft hair present on the face, shoulders, and back.
