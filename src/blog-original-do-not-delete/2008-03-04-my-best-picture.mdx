<Image src={pic1} alt="Aarush & Santanu"/>  
Aarush has crossed the 6-week mark now, and until recently, there was no picture of him with me. Well, there was no specific reason for the same. Normally, when I leave for work, he is sleeping, and in the evening, it is dark, and we avoid using flash while taking pictures of Aarush. That leaves only the weekends, but recent weekends were very hectic, and I was away in Bangalore, and the stories go on...

So, one fine morning just before leaving for work, we had a photo session, and according to me, it came out the best. Special thanks go to Pamela for capturing this magical moment. *Now I have to click some pictures of Mama and son* ;)
