Hello, Bombay! I've returned after a four-week official visit to Singapore, and while I didn't play the tourist, my camera captured whatever caught my eye along the way. Stay tuned for a photo reelâ€”although, fair warning, none of these shots are from Mumbai Airport; they're glimpses from Kolkata (Calcutta). Keep an eye out for the upcoming visual journey!
