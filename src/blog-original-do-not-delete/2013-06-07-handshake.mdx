Today, Mr. David Thomson displayed a remarkable act of humility. During the official inauguration of our new office, he personally shook hands with every member of the front row. Fortunately, I arrived early and had the privilege of experiencing his firm handshake.

Mr. Thomson is one of the wealthiest individuals I have ever seen in person. He was even ranked among the top 10 richest people according to Forbes a few years ago. His humble gesture left a lasting impression on all of us.
