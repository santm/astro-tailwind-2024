We set out early in the morning after having breakfast around 8:00 AM. Unfortunately, luck wasn't on our side, as we had an unpleasant cab driver this time, unlike the one in Jaipur. Although we had hired the cab through the hotel and specifically asked to be taken to Osyian, the driver insisted on going to the majestic sandstone palace of **Umaid Bhawan**. Before taking us there, he detoured to some shops for early morning shopping, a move we didn't appreciate (*they receive commissions when they take clients to these places*). Eventually, we reached Umaid Bhawan, but it wasn't open yet, so we had to wait until it opened. One part of the palace has been converted into a *5-star hotel*, the second part is where the *king stays*, and the third part is a *museum* open to the public.

From there, we asked the driver to take us to **Osyian**, a place famous for a cluster of ruined **Brahmanical and Jain** temples dating from the 8th to 11th centuries. He took us to the *Sachiya Mata temple* but insisted on hiring a guide of his choice, which we didn't particularly like but had to accept. These temples are beautifully designed in terms of architecture. To enter the Sachiya Mata temple complex, you pass through a series of magnificently sculpted arches. The outside walls of the temple are adorned with beautiful sculptures of different deities. In addition to the Sachiya Mata temple, there are several small temples in the vicinity, including a *Jain temple, Surya temple, Vishnu temple, Shiv Mandir, Pippala Devi temple, and Harihara temple*. The temples are raised on massive plinths, and almost every space in the temples is intricately sculpted. The temple ceilings are adorned with intricate lace-like motifs.

Osyian holds great significance for the Jain community. The entire temple complex is meticulously and beautifully carved, making it well worth a visit. It takes almost 2 hours to explore this area.

It was nearly noon when we left for **Mandore Garden**, said to be the maternal place of Queen Mandodari, the wife of King Ravana of Sri Lanka. This site is somewhat neglected but features fine architecture. The garden houses cenotaphs and memorials of many rulers, which are worth seeing. The garden also has a stepwell (*baoli*) and a hall of heroes with 15 carved figures, all crafted from a single piece of red sandstone. As it was scorching hot, we had some ice cream here.

We then headed towards **Mehrangarh Fort**, but once again, our cab driver insisted on taking us to a few shops of his choice. After visiting a couple of places and seeing our irritated expressions, he finally took us to the fort. Mehrangarh Fort is one of the largest forts with massive ramparts built around the edges. We hired a guide here who showed us the intricate carvings in various parts of the fort, including *Moti Mahal, Sheesh Mahal, Phool Mahal, Zenana Deodi, Chamunda Mataji Temple, and the museum*, which houses an exquisite collection of palanquins, elephant howdahs, weaponry, paintings, musical instruments, turbans, and more. The entry to the fort is through various gates, including *Jai Pol, Fateh Pol, Dedh Kamgra Pol, and Loha Pol*. The top of the fort offers breathtaking views of the **Blue City** of Brahmapur. Traditionally, Brahmin households in the city paint the outside walls of their houses blue, which gives the city its distinctive appearance. From the fort, you can see the winding roads leading in and out of the city. We had a late lunch within the fort's premises to avoid taking our cab driver to a place of his choice, and it was already 5:00 PM.

Next, we asked him to take us to **Jaswant Thada**, although he claimed it was closed by 5:00 PM. We insisted on going there, and to our delight, they allowed us in even though it was about to close. Jaswant Thada is another architectural landmark made of white marble. These marble structures are extremely thin, polished, and intricately carved, giving off a warm glow when the sun's rays dance across their surface.

After visiting Jaswant Thada, we headed straight back to the hotel, as we had already checked out in the morning. We wanted to freshen up, so we requested a room for one hour. Later, we had dinner at a nearby mall at McDonald's. We had a late-night train to Jaisalmer.
