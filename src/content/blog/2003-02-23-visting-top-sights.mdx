title: Visting top sights

Another delightful weekend in March, and we're on a mission to explore all the top sights from our guidebook. We have to give credit where it's due – this book is a fantastic and thoughtful gift from Akiko and others. A shoutout to the highly recommended guidebook on **Paris by Avant Guide**.

This time, our journey began at **St. Chappell** in the heart of Paris. The craftsmanship on the glass windows depicting Bible stories was truly wonderful. Right next to it, we marveled at the high court of France. On our way back to the hotel, we hopped off at Av. des Champs-Élysées. After strolling along the famous road, we decided to tackle the challenge of climbing the 200+ circular steps to reach the top of the Arc de Triomphe. The effort was entirely worthwhile as the panoramic view of the 12 roads converging at that point was breathtaking. We enjoyed our time pinpointing other major landmarks with the limited knowledge we had of Paris.

As dawn approached, the lights on the Eiffel Tower illuminated, presenting a truly magnifique sight.

>In the initial days when people used to ask us have we been to Champs-Élysées, we used to say NO as the way it is pronouced and it is written for non Francofonic is completely different. The name is derived from Greek mythology which I had no clue till I was told about it by one French co-worker.
