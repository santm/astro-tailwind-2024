It all started in early 2002. After a few correspondences between our parents, I was asked to come to India in April. 

After some traveling around, on the very last day, I met Pamela in person in Bombay on 27th April. It did not take much time to decide about the biggest step of our life. 

After phone calls and emails for the next six months, we got married on 8th November in Calcutta. 

I reached Siliguri on 5th November, whereas Pamela reached Calcutta on 30th October from Durg. 

I, with a few of my family members, reached Calcutta on 8th morning by an overnight train journey. The main function was at night, which started around late evening and ended at 2 AM. 

The next day, in the evening, we started again for Siliguri from Calcutta. 

There was a reception at Siliguri on 11th. 

We started for Durg on 14th to attend another reception there. It was for all those who could not attend the wedding reception in Calcutta. 

 We started from Durg again on 15th for Siliguri via Calcutta.Yes!! We did traveled a lot on Indian Railways that time. On the way to Durg, Pamela applied for her US visa at Calcutta on 15th. And finally on 23rd we started for California.
