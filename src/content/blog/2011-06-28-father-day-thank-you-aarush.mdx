In the month of May, some sudden events occurred that changed my life as a father. I am quite positive about this sudden turn of events as it appears to be for the better. Pamela unexpectedly secured a teaching job with one of Bangalore's premier institutes, and they asked her to join immediately. The first week involved training in Kormangala, which was manageable because Aarush had his summer camp at his old school. The school also offered daycare facilities, so he adapted to the new routine relatively easily for the first week.

The reality on the ground was quite different but filled with fun. During the first week, Pamela had to reach her training by 8:30 AM, and she wasn't yet comfortable driving in Bangalore's traffic. So, we hired a temporary driver from an agency while we searched for a permanent one. This meant that I lost the luxury of having the car, and I resorted to using BMTC buses. The enjoyable yet challenging part was becoming a morning dad for Aarush. I now had to prepare him for school, including showering and breakfast. To my delight, Aarush showed a positive attitude as he realized that this new person taking care of him was a bit different from his beloved mother.

At the end of May, we had a two-week vacation planned to visit my parental home. My younger brother was coming from California, and we were going to celebrate our nephew's 'rice ceremony' (Sheryaan). Initially, we considered canceling the trip because Pamela couldn't go due to her new job. However, this was a significant event that we didn't want to miss, but it meant Aarush had to come with me as he couldn't be left alone in Bangalore. I had to rebook air tickets, which put a serious dent in my credit card. I had to remind Aarush about this upcoming big trip every morning while preparing him for school. On the day of departure, he seemed to think it was more of my trip than his, as his bag wasn't that big. However, at the airport, he was okay and we quickly moved through check-in and security before boarding the flight. The late flight from Bangalore, starting at 21:00 and reaching Calcutta close to midnight, was comfortable. Aarush expressed a desire for food during the flight, and after eating, he fell asleep. Upon reaching Calcutta, we took a taxi to our hotel, where some inquisitive eyes asked about his mother. Given the late hour, Aarush slept easily.

The next morning, we had a noon flight to Siliguri, which was previously rescheduled. Therefore, we left the hotel later and enjoyed a leisurely brunch. At the airport, Aarush opted for idli (one of his favorites), while I had a cup of coffee. Aarush was thrilled with the ATR aircraft and its wings, compared to the jet from the previous day. It was a day flight, and he could see many things outside the window. When we reached Siliguri and our home, Aarush was doing fine. He was like a hero in the eyes of many. On the day of our return, he was excited to go back to Bangalore and reunite with Pamela, whom he missed for four days.

The return flight was smooth, and Aarush slept for most of the journey between Calcutta and Bangalore, waking up only upon reaching the Bangalore Airport.

On June 8th, he started attending DPS School. For the first three days, I had to accompany him, but from the 13th onwards, he began taking the school bus. The new routine was demanding as Aarush had to get ready in just 50 minutes to reach the bus stop within the Godrej Campus by 7:30 AM. Every morning, he would suggest it was a school holiday, but once on the bus, he was okay. It has been two weeks now, and he goes by bus, returning to daycare for lunch, a nap, and then Pamela picks him up after school. So far, the new role has been good, but it's certainly demanding.

> We watched 'Taare Zameen Par' one weekend, but Aarush didn't enjoy it much. He loves the song 'Bum Bum Bole,' but the whole school system, punishment, and separation from family made him sad. He didn't like the whole experience of the character Ishaan. It seems it wasn't a good idea to watch it with him.
