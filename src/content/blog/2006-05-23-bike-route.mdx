title: Bike Route
---
Just [uploaded a few pictures](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/paris/cycle) from my bike route, as promised in an [earlier post](http://blog.santm.com/2006/05/04/envy-me-if-you-can/). I attempted to capture a cinematic moment during my ride with an aging digital camera amidst last weekend's rain and storms. To enhance the experience, I tinkered with MPG4 and QuickTime, offering a glimpse into the scenic beauty.

The MOV version weighs in at approximately *7 MB*, albeit with a mediocre quality. On the other hand, the QuickTime version, while larger at around 26MB, boasts superior visual fidelity. The audio track features Purbayan and Satyajit playing "Mishra-Pilo" at a live concert in Paris back in 2003. 

*Please be cautious about your connection speed before initiating the download, as it might take a considerable amount of time.*

Venturing into the realm of video formats is a new territory for me, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to drop a comment. Let's make this visual journey even more captivating!
