We moved to Paris almost a year back from US. We try to travel around at

least once a month outside of Paris. This year so far we have been to

Zurich, Mt. Saint Michel and Barcelona.



I like Paris but some time French system and people makes me mad. I am

going to run Paris Half marathon in March first week. Now a days I am

trying to run more regularly. Got an I-Pod recently, its cool to enjoy

music while commuting on public transport to work. Pamela is studying

French more and keeping herself busy with that.



That is all keep in touch.
