title: A year in Paris
---
We moved to Paris almost a year back from US. We try to travel around at
least once a month outside of Paris. This year so far we have been to
Zurich, Mt. Saint Michel and Barcelona.

I like Paris but some time French system and people makes me mad. I am
going to run Paris Half marathon in March first week. Now a days I am
trying to run more regularly. Got an I-Pod recently(from US as price diffrene was quite significant), its cool to enjoy
music while commuting on public transport to work. 

Pamela is studying French more and keeping herself busy with that.

That is all keep in touch.
