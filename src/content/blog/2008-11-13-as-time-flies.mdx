We are elated to commemorate our sixth year of togetherness at IndiJoe. It has been a journey filled with sweet, bitter, sour, spicy, and many more flavors. After experiencing softer items like paper and linen, we have now reached the "Iron Anniversary," symbolizing this milestone ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary)).

This year's anniversary holds extra significance as we have received a precious gift from Godâ€”our son, Aarush. Transitioning from a "couple" to a "small family" has been an amazing experience. For the first time, we celebrated not just as a couple but as parents. Aarush was in high spirits, making it possible for us to enjoy our lunch buffet. Despite the constraint of time, we had to indulge quickly. By the time we reached for dessert, Aarush was eager to explore and crawl around the restaurant.
