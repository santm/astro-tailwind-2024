After a deep slumber, the next morning we woke up fresh and energetic.

Aarush wanted to play, seeing an open space - courtyard. They have toys, cycles, carom board, badminton court, balls to play with. He was really happy to get all these stuff. *What more parent wants if the kid is happy, you are happy; otherwise, nothing on earth can make you happy.*

In the morning, we were shown all rooms available there. It was a nice room with a central common area and one room each on either side. 
Each room can easily accommodate a family of three (two adults and one child) at the main building, while the bamboo room can accommodate 4 in each room. We opted for a room at the main building.

The huge banana and green paddy plantation in front of the home-stay is a wonderful delight to the eyes!! Then leisurely we freshened up and gobbled down the breakfast prepared. Her breakfast area is an open space with a neat dining set, covered by a thatched roof with a lovely breeze and a great view. Meanwhile, Nash asked us what we wanted to do and suggested what we can. He gave all route directions. Honestly, I didn't want to do much but relax.

We decided to go to **Thirunelly temple** and **Kuruvadweep**. Thirunelli temple is nestled amidst three hills. The deity worshiped here is Lord Krishna, but the place gained popularity for the Papanasini river (rather a stream flowing beside the temple). The road to the temple passes via **Mananthavady** town from Panamaram is hilly with bumpy roads and green all around. You get to pass through fields and forest. Picturesque for sure. We drove the road that connects **Wayand** with **Coorg** and at the end, we took a left turn (14 KM) for the temple. This temple is a peaceful and serene place. Since the temple is not properly restored, I wouldn't recommend visiting it unless you just want to drive or have some religious rites to perform. 

Then from there, we went to Kuruvadweep. Roads didn't improve much. As the drive went on, different shades of green we could find all around Wayanad. Nice treat to the eyes; our eyes were relaxed seeing green all around. Since we stay in a concrete jungle, for us, it was really paradise. The water was knee-deep, muddy, and not very clean because there were a lot of plastics and junk from tourists and local shops. We didn't feel like crossing it. If you have time, you can take a boat ride.

In the evening, the owner, Mrs. Seetha of the home-stay, offered us hot coffee. Coffee and tea served are unlimited without charges and ensured that we were served with hot sumptuous dinner once Aarush's dinner was over. This was really nice of her.
