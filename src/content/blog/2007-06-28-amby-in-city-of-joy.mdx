Calcutta (Kolkata) – the mega city of Eastern India. In this vibrant city with a distinct socio-political culture, cabs are the grand old **Ambassadors** from Hindustan Motors, and most cars are manufactured at the nearby plant of Uttarpara. This picture was taken next to the major long-distance Sealdah Railway Station, highlighting that the **city of joy** still struggles with traffic congestion. Unlike other major cities where Tata Indica, Fiat, or Maruti are common hired forms of mechanized transport, this city has almost all taxis as **amby**, painted in yellow.

Before Maruti, it was the only car on Indian roads. This reminds me of my childhood when my brother and I used to identify a Mark-II, Mark-III, or Mark-IV by its sound (all these models looked very similar). It was a silly game in the era of Nintendo – Wii. The game was simple - we used to hide behind a wall, hear an Ambassador approaching, try to identify it by sound, and confirm as soon as it passed by.

While writing this post, I found [the webpage](http://www.hmambassador.com/) of this car and discovered 10 reasons to buy it:

1. First Indian car – born in 1950 (inception in 1948. Originally based on Morris Oxford, United Kingdom)
2. Power Steering – Trying to match up the new market with Maruti, TATA, Honda, and Toyota.
3. Multi Fuel Injection – Well, all new cars have that - what a big deal?
4. Company fitted CNG – Well, you can convert almost every petrol car in India to keep your running cost as low as 1 Rupees for 1 KM.
5. Tough
6. Tough - tested on Indian roads for a long time, but why list the toughness twice?
7. Roominess - Yes, more than 10 people can travel in a single car at a given time!!
8. 5 Speed Gearbox - Another lame reason; all cars nowadays have the same.
9. Easy repairable – They claim across the country all mechanics know the car inside out.
10. Serves the country – Used by the Indian Army and de-facto car of Indian bureaucrats and politicians.

If I ever have enough money, I would like to have a chauffeur-driven Amby for myself, just to hang out in nostalgia, or in the roomy car, or to be different from everyone else! **My eleventh reason or maybe the only reason for having this car.**
