Friends and near ones used to ask me quite often then - *Do you feel the movement?*

***No*** (used to be my reply).

Somewhere, I used to wonder how it feels like the movement of the baby inside. It was tough to answer as a first-timer. During a routine check-up, my doctor asked the same whether I feel the movement, and I nodded in the negative. Immediately, I asked her how it actually feels. She says like bubbles or you'll feel tiny flutters as your baby moves â€“ I smiled and said **yes**. I had my very first experience on the 5th month.

There's something really special about feeling your baby's kicking, squirming. You begin to realize that some life is really inside you, and that is just as exciting as the first time you heard your baby's heartbeat or caught a glimpse of her moving during the first sonography.

You begin to feel the movements as your baby's bones harden. *Movements become more intense with the hardening of bones as the baby grows*. First-time moms like me usually feel their babies move a bit later than experienced ones.

As naughty as our son already is, he used to kick as if having a fist-fight inside or trying to create more space for himself by stretching. Even his dad could feel his kicks by placing his hand on my belly. We enjoyed it as he used to mark his presence by movements. At an earlier stage, it used to be rare, but slowly and slowly I felt his kicks several times a day, every day. It is just amazing! Later, even the doctor asked me to keep a count of the number of movements. According to her, it should be 10-12 per day. At certain times, I felt jabs from his arms and legs. But **the baby does not move all the time**. They have their own patterns.
