When I was on my vacation last week in Spain and Portugal, was thinking

about to write down all that we had experienced there - the places we

visted and food we tasted and others. But back to work it is such a

Dilbert place that I can not explain with my logic.



Also I need to find a cheap solution to restore pictures from Smart

Media. It looks like there is a well suited option commercial for 40

Euros. But I am still looking around for a free one if I can as I am not

going to use the same again.



Stay tuned for experiences from Madrid, Granada, Seville and Lisbon.
