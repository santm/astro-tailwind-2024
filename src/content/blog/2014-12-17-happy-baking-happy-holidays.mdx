We enter the last 2 weeks of the year 2014. This year I baked consistently at least one or two cake(s) a month and at times little more. I love baking and getting better with it as I practice more. There are few things which you learn about oven to other kitchen appliance and their unique characteristic.  Got a dedicated  simple cake book and hand mixer to experiment more. Some pictures from recent time.  

So far tried  

> -   *Normal Sponge Cake*
> -   *Carrot walnut cake*
> -   *Mocha pudding *
> -   *Date Cake*
> -   *Honeyed Apple slice*
