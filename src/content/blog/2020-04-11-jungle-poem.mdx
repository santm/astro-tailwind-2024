#### 2019 July  @ Bangalore ####

A land of leaves  
And magnificent beasts  
Live with grace  
In a Happy place  
The JUNGLE is the best place.  

Where tigers growl  
Squirrel squeak
You'll hear heavenly tunes.  

Waterfalls roaring  
Trees are clapping  
Gentle buzzing in the stream  
the forest my home
I will never leave it.
