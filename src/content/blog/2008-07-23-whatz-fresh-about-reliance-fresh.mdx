As newcomers to Bangalore, we've been actively exploring nearby hypermarkets, supermarkets, and open markets while settling in. This endeavor not only assists us in finding essential supplies but also provides an opportunity to discover places around us. Our initial exploration led us to **BIG-BAZAR** on Old Madras road, conveniently close to one of our office addresses in Bangalore. Familiarity with the route spared us from the risk of getting lost. 

In subsequent weekends, we ventured to **SPAR** at Koramangala and **Nilgiris**. Hypermarket Spar stood out with its offering of rare vegetables like asparagus, lettuce leaves, and endive. The cheese selection was impressive, featuring varieties such as brie, blue cheese, parmesan, ricotta, emmental, gouda, and feta. Along the way, we explored several small to medium-scale stores like **More**, **SMART**, among others, without following a specific pattern.

On our journey toward Sarjapur junction on Outer Ring Road, a sign for **Reliance Fresh** caught our eye. Intrigued, we decided to check it out. To our dismay, we were greeted by an unpleasant stench that dominated the entire store. The floor was unkempt, items were falling off shelves, and there was no semblance of organization, with stale vegetables adding to the unpleasant experience. Moreover, the store staff seemed indifferent and unfriendly towards customers.

In our observations, Nilgiris emerged as a winner in terms of cleanliness, organization, and overall management. Despite the vastness and the weekend crowd madness at Big-Bazar, the show keeps running, though one may need to endure long queues at the cash counter.

We invite your comments to share your perspectives on supermarkets. This post is the [second installment related to supermarkets in India](http://blog.santm.com/2007/03/10/upgrade-in-market). What's your take?
