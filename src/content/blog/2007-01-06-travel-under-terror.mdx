Last summer, Mumbai faced a wave of massive bomb blasts within its local train network. In the aftermath, commuters are now constantly reminded to remain vigilant and be aware of their surroundings. Managing the colossal number of daily train commuters in Mumbai poses a logistical nightmare, and describing it as "impossible" might be the most accurate term.

A few months ago, after extensive planning and public announcements, the Mumbai Police organized a security drill. The objective was to guide every passenger through metal detectors at two main terminuses in the evening. However, the practicality of this approach quickly became apparent. The sheer volume of passengers, numbering in lakhs and crores, heading home overwhelmed the police, leading to the drill's abandonment. While it proved feasible in theory, implementing such measures on a regular basis seems unattainable.

Despite the challenges, each station does have one or two personnel in khaki uniforms. However, their physical appearance, marked by bulging waistlines, raises concerns about their fitness for the role. The reality is that personal safety in Mumbai during a terrorist attack seems to hinge on probability. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time puts you in danger, with the city operating under the influence of the ubiquitous "Bhai" (a common term for influential figures). A strong nexus between the underworld and various thriving industries in Mumbai, including movie-making, real estate, and jewelry, is an open secret.

As we await the next chapter in Mumbai's dynamic narrative, remember to commute safely. In the city of Mumbai, the resilience of its people remains a testament to their spiritâ€”Mumbaians, stay safe and happy commuting.
