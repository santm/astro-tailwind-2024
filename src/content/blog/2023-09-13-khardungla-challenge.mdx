Proud to share man of the house Santanu just finished one of his heart's desires...or I should say ticked one from his bucket list.....yes KHARDUNGLA Challenge(72 KM)  - the highest ultra marathon in the world at the height of 17,618 ft.

Not only this, me and Aarush bow to his endurance. Starting with the 27th Aug. Hyderabad full marathon he flew to Leh to get acclimatized to the high altitude. After almost 11 days of being in Leh, he ran KC on 8th September and then the Ladakh full marathon (at 11,155ft - 42kms)on 10th Sept. which is around Leh city.
