title: Purbayan and Satyajit
---
Jaya (my cousin sister) and her husband Purbayan paid us a visit, accompanied by Satyajit. They were in Paris for their own private concert as part of their European tour, showcasing their talents in Indian classical music with Purbayan on sitar and Satyajit on tabla.

It was a rainy day, despite the rain causing us to be a bit tardy to the concert, it turned out to be a memorable performance. An evening filled with beautiful music, creating lasting impressions.

The week that started on a sour note with the Metro strike concluded on a delightful one, thanks to the uplifting concert experience.
