Jaya(my cousin sister) and her hubby Purbayan visited us along with

Satyajit on very rainy Sunday. They came to Paris for their own private

concert. They were on a tour to Europe and playing Indian classical

music. Purbayan(sitar) and Satyajit (tabla) are very talented in their

own field.It was our great pleasure to have them as guest. Due to rain

we reached the concert bit late but it was a great performance. An

evening, which I will remember for a long time.A very bad week with

Metro strike ended in delight.You can find lots of web sites...
