I wanted to take pictures of Paris famous landmarks in the twilight with
a tripod. We started with Sacre-coeur Basilica. And the picture we got
from there was really great as we were there on the right time. The sky
color was perfect for the camera and it was just lighted.  
  
From there we went to Moulin-Rouge; the famous cabaret of Paris then to
Assembly National the French Parliament. We crossed Seine and came to
Concord. From there we went to Invalids, the military museum and resting
place for Napoleon.
The night ended after 5 hours when we took the picture of Eiffel tower
from the **Pont de Garigliano** the nearest bridge on Seine from our
place.
We went to Arc-de-Triomph another evening soon to finish this series of
pictures. It is always beautiful to capture the lights in city of lights
