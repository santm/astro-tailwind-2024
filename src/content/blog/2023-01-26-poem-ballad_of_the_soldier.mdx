title: Ballad of the Soldier
---

Here they stand  
Brave and strong  
Where the frigid mountain wind howls a tragic song  
A melody of sorrow and despair  
They are away from home, shelter, or care  
  
Here they march  
Their footsteps rattle the earth  
Their faces betray no emotion of misery, anger, pain, or mirth  
Their trusty guns at their side  
The regiment at it's  might  
The soldiers march to the battle-field ready for the fight  
  
On this battleground  
Where the dying and dead are strewn around  
They bravely attack, protect, and martyr themselves  
With bullets and bombs, for their dedication  
Protects our nation
