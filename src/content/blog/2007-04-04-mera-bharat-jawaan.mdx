Another amusing advertisement that caught my attention is **"Budda Hoga Tera Baap"**, which can be taken as a soft or hard slang depending on your perspective, translating to **"Maybe your father is old."** The new TV series is named **"Mera Bharat Jaawan"**, which translates to **"My India is Young."** With one-fourth of the population under the age of 25, India definitely boasts a young demographic.

P.S - In the last two months, I have changed the theme for the WordPress blog at least four times. It has resulted in either a broken site or broken functionality. I am very pleased to see some recent comments on our website. It really boosts morale to keep posting pictures, thoughts, and experiences. In the coming weeks, I plan to give a new look to the [front page](http://www.santm.com/) as we are no longer staying in Paris and update [Pamela's corner](http://pamela.santm.com/) as well. Cheers!
