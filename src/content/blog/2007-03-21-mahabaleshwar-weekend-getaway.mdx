Unlike [last time](/blog/2007-02-18-a-day-break-harihareshwar/), we booked our trip with a bus agency for 700 Rs (for 2 persons). Our reporting time was 00:15 AM at **Kharghar node**, but we arrived quite early at 11:30 PM, fearing we might not find public transport to reach on time. We waited for our bus and waited some more. It was about 12:30 AM, and there was still no sign of our bus. We called the bus counter, and they informed us that it was running late and had just started from the other side of Mumbai-suburbs.

By 1:00 AM, there was still no sign of our bus. All the shops had closed down, and everyone else around us had boarded their respective buses and left. There we were, two people with bags, sitting on the pavement in the middle of the night. ***Phew!*** We kept cursing ourselves, thinking about the difficulties we might face if we had to return home. Finally, at 1:30 AM, our bus arrived.


This time, we also booked our hotel beforehand with **MTDC**. You can check availability and book the room of your choice from your own PC. The only catch is that you'll pay a heavy penalty if you change your mind at the last moment. We booked the Krishna cottage for 1450 Rs per night. MTDC is located near the road to Pratapgad outside of the city center, with dwelling units covered in thick greenery. The road on which MTDC is located is quite desolate. The **PWD guest house** is adjacent to this resort, equally or rather more charming. Tourists of MTDC can walk into the PWD guest house, stroll, and even have food at the PWD restaurant. Another beauty of the PWD bungalow is the sunset spot, which we unfortunately missed. The beautiful lawn in front of the PWD bungalow overlooks the whole range of Sahyadri, with no crowd. It's much better than Mahabaleshwarâ€™s famous sunset spot. The lonely road is a good jogging track, or one can enjoy a pleasant walk or relax in the backyard of the cottage, listening to the chirping of various birds. The 30 cottages are the most beautiful part of this resort. It's a heaven for nature lovers, shrouded in greenery, offering stress relief. The trees sway in the wind, and the swishing sound engulfs you, making you feel relaxed.

Since we reached early in the morning, we had the option of choosing a cottage of our choice. We picked lucky 13 close to the PWD guest house. The cottage rooms are quite spacious and have good, clean, big bathrooms. The rooms are equipped with a television, useful only if you plan on staying indoors.

Not accustomed to nocturnal bus journeys, we were groggy. Moreover, Santanu wanted to relax rather than rush from one point to another. After having breakfast at the PWD guest house, we took a nap to recharge ourselves. With nothing better to do, we set off for Panchgani, Pratapgarh, and Wai at noon. Though taxi drivers had fixed rate cards, we bargained for 1000 Rs for the three places.

We started with Panchmari, named after five hills that surround it. This trip included Parsi point and tableland. Parsi point is famous for the best view of Krishna valley below, and tableland offers a panoramic view of Panchgani itself. It's the largest plateau in Asia, where a small plane can land. Situated 60 meters high on the eastern side of the town, it protects Panchgani from strong winds and heavy rainfall, making this hill station enjoyable all year round. It stretches far beyond the eye can see. On the way, we visited the **strawberry garden** where you can buy all the fresh products available there. We bought strawberry jam.

From here, we went to Wai, the foothills of Panchgani, an ancient town with temples. It is believed that the Pandavas stayed here in disguise during their exile. The **Dolya Ganapati Temples** on the bank of the Krishna river are well-preserved from their times.

After a late lunch, we set off for Pratapgarh, about 26 kilometers from Mahabaleshwar, on the opposite side of our first two destinations. This is the fort where the legendary confrontation between Shivaji and Afzal Khan took place, with Shivaji emerging victorious. At Pratapgarh, we hired a government-recognized guide, Satish, for 80 Rs, who was very informative and helpful for taking our snaps. He explained every aspect of it in detail. The fort was quite fascinating, and we climbed up some 400 odd steps to enjoy the view from the top. There is a splendid view of the lush green valley, and the forts Raigad and Makarandgad can also be viewed on a clear day. Unfortunately, we were not lucky enough to have crystal clear weather; rather, it was hazy. On the east and south, the hills have steep slopes covered with dense forest, in contrast with the rocky west and north. The hills gradually descend to the valleys, separating Mahabaleshwar and Kineshwar range on the east and the Konkan valley on the west. We enjoyed the sunset on our way back to Mahabaleshwar from one of the Shayadri ranges.

At twilight, we headed towards our cottage. Suddenly, there was a strike in the city, and all the shops were closed. This situation caught every visitor off-guard, and everyone approached the MTDC restaurant for dinner. Though tired and famished, we had to wait for 2 hours, as the small kitchen was not capable of handling such big volumes of orders in one evening. What chaos it was. Oh GOD!!!
