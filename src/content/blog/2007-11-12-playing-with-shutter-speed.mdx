I love capturing images using long shutter speeds at night. The technique is quite straightforwardâ€”all I needed was a tripod to stabilize the camera and prevent any shaking while leaving the shutter open. Although I acknowledge that this may not be a stellar photograph, it's the result of an attempt from my balcony. A better image featuring the Kharghar landmark, Utsav Chowk, has been posted.

Feel free to share your thoughts or experiences with night photography techniques!
