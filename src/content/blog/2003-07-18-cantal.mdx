Our initial venture into the French countryside led us to Cantal, a central region, for a delightful three-day excursion on July 14th, accompanied by Murali and Joydeep. 

Cantal, nestled in France's Massif Central, boasts the distinction of being the largest volcanic structure in Europe. Our mode of transport was a car, with Murali expertly navigating the wheel and Joydeep providing directions, while we two occasionally dozed off in the back seat. The journey unfolded before us a natural tapestry of rolling hills, verdant farmlands, petite mountains, woodlands, and valleys.

Although our primary goal was hiking, the oppressive heat thwarted our plans. An attempt on one of the mountains was abandoned midway due to the scorching sun overhead, rendering it unbearable. Our night stay at a family-run hotel exceeded expectations, with the hosts proficient in English, providing excellent hospitality, and serving delicious homemade French cuisine in the form of a five-course dinner.

We ventured to Grandval Lake, featuring a bridge constructed by Gustave Eiffel spanning 584 meters. This metal marvel, boasting a solitary parabolic arc, once bore the weight of trains and withstood formidable transverse winds for years, although it no longer serves as a railway bridge. Adjacent to the bridge, we dined at a restaurant where we relished **Confit de canard** (duck) for the first time, followed by a mouthwatering dessert.

Adjusting our plans due to a relentless heatwave, we returned to Paris the following day, treating ourselves to a Japanese lunch near Luxembourg Gardens.
