### 2004 June 
The Tuscan region offers a plethora of day-trip options from Florence, and our choice was **Siena**, just an hour away. We were drawn to Siena's medieval charm, especially considering its historical conflict with Florence, which ended with Florence emerging victorious.

Journeying through the Tuscan countryside by road is a mesmerizing experience, especially as you traverse those picturesque hills featured on countless postcards. However, fatigued from our extensive walk on Florence's cobblestone streets the day before, I succumbed to a doze as soon as we hit the highway, much to Santanu's dismay as he couldn't share those picturesque moments.

The bus conveniently dropped us near the city center, where we explored the top sightsâ€”**Piazza del Campo** square (housing the city hall, museum, and bell tower) and the cathedral (complete with a baptistery, cathedral museum, and a panoramic viewpoint) of this medieval town characterized by twisting alleyways.

Siena's city square, a uniquely shell-shaped piazza, is expansive and serves as the primary landmark, accessible only by foot or taxi. **Via di Citta** (Main Street) boasts numerous leather shops, alongside a myriad of other establishments. However, we found the shops along this narrow lane exorbitantly priced and overly crowded with tourists. Undeterred, we strolled along the street and treated ourselves to mouth-watering pizza at a local restaurant for lunch.

Siena's cathedral captivates with its black and white marble columns and intricate mosaics on the floor. Noteworthy is the splendid Bernini statue of **Mary Magdalene** (a familiar reference from *The Da Vinci Code*), discreetly nestled in a marble niche. The Duomo remains unfinished, exposing a half-constructed outer wall. Every available inch of the interior, from walls to ceilings and floors, is adorned with elaborate decorations. Adjacent to the cathedral, the Piccolomini library is another must-see.

Later, we meandered to **San Domenico (Basilica Cateriniana)**, savoring delicate and creamy gelatos as we explored this vast Gothic church distinguished by its minimalist design, devoid of ornate marble work.

Finally, we retraced our steps to the bus stop for Florence, ensuring my eyes stayed wide open this time.

In the morning, we crossed Florence's renowned open market. Unfortunately, we were too early on our first attempt and too late on our return in the evening.
