While navigating a small by-lane in Bangalore, I stumbled upon a parking masterpiece. Parking has always been a challenge for me, especially parallel parking between cars on the street. My first attempt to secure a Californian driving license ended in failure as my rear tire grazed the curb.

This particular parking spot, however, seems tailored for a small car, and I admit, I wouldn't be able to execute such precision. It appears that the owner has no plans to change cars, given the customized nature of the parking space.```
