title: New widget with Media RSS
---

It had been a while since I had delved into new technology and made any changes to the way this blog looks to you. I liked a few themes and [tried to incorporate them into my own taste](http://blog.santm.com/?theme=EG) before settling on the current one. However, somehow those themes didn't appear as cool and attractive to me in the end. So, I stuck with the current one and didn't make many changes.

I was searching for a widget on the sidebar for a photo stream, with the most commonly used one on the net being the [Flickr badge](http://www.flickr.com/badge.gne "Flickr Badge"). I'm not very pleased with their account policy, so I don't have a pro account. While looking around, I discovered the coolest solution for my needs. I used [Cooliris](http://www.cooliris.com/) with [Media RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_RSS) to stream photos on the sidebar. Gallery2 doesn't come with Media RSS by default, but since I've been running [Gallery3 Beta](http://blog.santm.com/2009/05/08/gallerry-3-sneak-peak) for a while, I've been using the same. This means I didn't make any major script changes and got this cool widget.

Finally, I found [sIFR](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/) for titles. Doesn't it look right?
