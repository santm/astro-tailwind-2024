Aarush had been experiencing a persistent cough for a few months. Despite intermittent increases and subsequent relief with cough syrup, it never completely subsided. We explored different remedies suggested by experienced parents. Last month, during his 15-month immunization visit, the doctor recommended consulting an ENT specialist due to the prolonged cough and speech delay. Following this advice, we scheduled an appointment with an ENT specialist at Manipal Hospital, who prescribed antibiotics. After two additional visits, it became evident that Aarush's ears still had congestion, prompting the suggestion of a microscopic operation by both the ENT specialist and his pediatrician.

Middle ear infections are quite common in children below 3 years, as explained on [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/tubes-for-ear-infections#ut1090 "Middle ear infections"). The process and details are further illustrated in a helpful [slideshow](http://www.webmd.com/hw-popup/tubes-for-ear-infections).

We completed all the pre-approval hospitalization forms and another set for the insurance company. Ensuring bed/room booking was in order, we prepared for the big day. Aarush was admitted the night before the operation, and we spent the night at the hospital. Aarush seemed to be in a playful mood, perhaps unaware of the impending procedure. Various doctors and nurses visited, advising that he should not consume any food or drink after midnight, as the operation was scheduled for the morning.

In the morning, Aarush received his hospital dress and wristband before heading to the operating room. Despite his cheerful demeanor, waiting outside the OT was tense, witnessing two other boys being treated in emergencies. We recognized [KOUSIK](http://kousik.blogspot.com/ "Kousik") and his son Iravan, whom we knew virtually through their blog. Though we refrained from a formal introduction, we wished Iravan a quick recovery.

Aarush's operation concluded within 45 minutes. He was cranky and cried a lot upon returning from the OT. An IV fluid channel was set up in his right hand, and he tried to remove it. After some time, we moved back to our special room around 11 AM, and Aarush, after incessant crying, finally slept and woke up a bit fresher around noon.

We offered him some Mosumbi juice, and by 1 PM, he had his lunch. Despite initial concerns, he finished his portion without any fuss. Around 2 PM, we visited his pediatrician, who reassured us that everything seemed normal. However, we still harbored worries about the cough, and the doctor mentioned it should improve, advising a follow-up in a week.

While awaiting the ENT specialist's visit for a release note, we reflected on the relief of not having to spend another night in the hospital unnecessarily. The doctor finally arrived around 4 PM, giving us the green signal for release. A big relief indeed!

After a good nap, Aarush, despite the needle on his right hand, appeared playful and adjusted well. Due to medical insurance requirements, we couldn't be released before completing 24 hours, meaning we were hostages until 9 PM.

Aarush's dinner arrived at 7 PM, and this time, he engaged in his usual routine for food, taking about an hour with pleading, chasing, and some floor cleaning involved. By 9 PM, we settled the payment, received the release order, and by 9:30 PM, we were out of the hospital.

P.S. Aarush is doing well (fingers crossed). We hope for a speedy recovery.
