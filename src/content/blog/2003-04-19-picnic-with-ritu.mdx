title: Picnic with Ritu
---
After a long exchange of emails and phone calls with Ritu, finally, we managed to meet her in person. She's a friend of Akiko's friend in Paris, creating a sort of friendship chain. It's a small start, but it means a lot in making social connections in a new place. Personally, I'm not the most social person when it comes to making friends at parties or other gatherings, which is why I've been hesitant to join local expat clubs.

Ritu came through by organizing a fantastic picnic, giving us the opportunity to meet other expatriates. It turned out to be a great day filled with lots of food and fun. The park (Parc-des-Buttes-Chaumont), located in the 19th arrondissement, was particularly beautiful â€“ a popular spot for newlyweds to capture their wedding pictures.
