#### 2019 August  @ Bangalore ####

In the land bordered by the might Himalayas in the North  
And by the vast ocean in the South  
On 15th August, India celebrates its Independence  
from bloody Terrony of foreign powers  
and so called 'British Dependence'  


All kinds of people, take part in the vast celebration
and taste the goodnes of liberation  
but, one must understand  
that patriotism does not mean celebrating for one day  
and forgetting respect for motherland ZZZZZZZ  

Patriotism means to be proud of the past 
respecting the nation

Not taking for granted that school, office be closed  
Take things with a different notion  
In developement, set a motion  
Make a change for a better nation  
Remember the struggle  
Be proud be bold to be a citizen of such a great nation.
