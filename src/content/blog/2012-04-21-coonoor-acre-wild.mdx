We followed the road suggested by Mr. Vijay to reach Coonoor, which was quite deserted except for a few local people; we were the only ones on that road. This road takes you through tea gardens and treats your eyes to stunning vistas.

Upon reaching Coonoor, we parked near the bus stand and had a quick thali lunch at a nearby bustling restaurant. Afterward, we made our way to **Farmstay - Wild Acre**. The directions provided by Mr. Mansoor were precise, and we arrived without any trouble. The location is right behind the Coonoor bus stand and is well-marked.

After settling in and a brief introduction to the farm and its produce by Deepak, we set out to explore Coonoor. Our first stop was the botanical garden, which boasts trees from all over the world. It's impressive to think of the British bringing plants from far-flung places, making themselves feel at home in a distant land. Whether in Shillong (the summer capital of Assam during British rule) or Coonoor, their legacy lives on in well-planned roads, beautiful lakes, and old British bungalows. Returning to the botanical garden, it is well-maintained, but the Indian tradition of picnicking and playing cricket anywhere and everywhere within the park might gradually wear down the green spaces.

Aarush wanted to take a boat ride, and since he was still upset about leaving RedHill behind, we managed to secure our turn quickly, as there was no proper queue for boating. The boat ride took just 10 minutes, and after some photo shoots here and there, we bid farewell to the botanical garden.

Next, we drove through Wellington, an area under the Indian Army's control. It houses an officer training camp and various other training facilities, including a golf course that lives up to its reputation. After a somewhat aimless drive, we headed back to Acre Wild. We descended from our cottage to the main dining area for dinner at around 8 PM, and we had to insist on them serving promptly. While the food was okay, the quality and service left something to be desired. Although Mr. Monsoon briefly appeared and promised to join us, after several minutes of waiting and with the food getting cold, we had our dinner, reminding them multiple times to have breakfast ready on time the next day.

## Day -2 

The following day, we woke up at around 7:00 AM and took a morning walk through the farm, capturing pictures of the birds and the surrounding scenic area before heading for breakfast. Breakfast included freshly baked bread and farm-made cheese, which was a definite improvement over dinner. We met another family from Bangalore who were visiting Coonoor for the second time. We shared our dinner experience from the previous night, and it turned out they had a similar experience on their first night and had chosen to prepare their own dinner.

We had big plans to ride the World Heritage Blue Rail from Coonoor to Ooty, explore Ooty city, and return. The railway station in Coonoor was small, and parking proved to be a challenge due to the multitude of taxis and vans waiting for tourists during the peak summer vacation season. We secured first-class train tickets and were advised by the parking attendant to wait and park once the parking lots cleared up after other passengers departed for Coonoor. However, it was not as simple as it sounded. It was congested, and while reversing, I scratched my bumper, prompting a chorus of honking from impatient onlookers. Meanwhile, Pamela called to inform me that the train was about to depart.

In the process, I missed the train and had to drive from Coonoor to Ooty, while Aarush and Pamela took the train. Pamela and Aarush were understandably upset, and Aarush cried the entire way, fearing his dad was lost. It was a total disaster. Now, after driving from Coonoor to Ooty (via the main highway this time), I waited at the railway station. Pamela seemed unhappy with the situation, but given the car's dent, she didn't have much to say.

However, having our own car had its advantages. We started our Ooty exploration at the botanical garden, albeit in a somewhat somber mood. This time, parking was more manageable, and as we strolled through the garden, it began to rain. We sought shelter in the glasshouse. After the botanical garden, we headed to Ooty's main market. From there, we went to Café Coffee Day for a break, and it rained once again. Fortunately, we managed to dodge the rain twice, unlike the drenched tourists shivering in the sudden downpour.

We had a late lunch at XXX and purchased the famous Ooty chocolate from King's Star. Afterward, we visited the Rose Garden. By that time, the chill in Ooty's air had set in after the rain, as the day was drawing to a close. After a complete tour of the Rose Garden, we headed back to Coonoor. The Rose Garden is extensive and boasts a wide variety of roses, from Japanese green to black.

Before returning to Acre Wild, we bought some packets of Maggi. It was raining heavily, but we were prepared to have a self-prepared dinner. This day ended on a high note as we had our car, which spared us from the rain.

The next day, breakfast once again disappointed us, with no cheese or fresh bread. It was a simple meal of plain toast and omelet. Mrs. Mansoor joined us for breakfast as both sets of guests were leaving for Bangalore. Perhaps she was there to ensure we settled our bills correctly. In any case, **I cannot rate this place highly for its hospitality**. They have a functional kitchen and clean bathrooms, and it's your choice to stay there or not. Maybe our expectations were high, coming from the excellent hospitality of Red Hills. We had read many positive comments on travel forums and blogs.

Before heading back to Ooty, we drove around Wellington once more. Navigating through Ooty's traffic served as a reminder of reality. The traffic police did their best to dissuade us from taking the shortest route (the 36 hairpin bend route), but we convinced them we would drive slowly and stay in 2nd gear the entire time. Coming downhill is always riskier than going up, but we followed the road's rules diligently. We drove in 2nd gear, refrained from speeding, avoided overtaking, and stuck to our lane.

We made a stop at Popeye's in Masinagudi, a fast food center serving French fries, burgers, and wraps. The place was clean, and they had decent food along with a clean restroom. What more could you ask for in the middle of nowhere?

As we crossed the Masinagudi jungle range, we encountered a few tuskers from the forest department. We didn't stop around Mysore and finally took a break at Café Coffee Day for some refreshment.
