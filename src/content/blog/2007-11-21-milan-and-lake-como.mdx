### 2004 June 

## Prologue

Embarking on a week-long journey through Italy takes us back to the summer of 2004. Despite various reasons, travelogues were never posted on time, though pictures from the trip were timely published. Please join us as we attempt to vividly recount the details of this memorable vacation from our faithful memory.

We boarded a night train from Bercy Station, Paris. Getting to Bercy was a bit of a journey from our Metro Station (Exelmans on M9) due to the lack of easy interchange. Although it appeared closer on the street map from our apartment, this train, while not a high-speed TGV, was swift enough to transport us from Paris to Venice overnight. Departing around 20:30, the summer evening was still bright as we left Paris. Opting for first class, the cabin resembled the AC 1st class compartments of Indian trains in size. Undoubtedly, the spotless and punctual services were incomparable. The only downside of this night train was missing the beauty of the Alps as we crossed them during the night.

## Journey Begins

Upon checking into our pre-booked hotel in the business center of Italy, **Milan**, and having breakfast, we set out to explore **Sforza Castle**, a rebuilt brick fortress, and **Parco Sempione**. The northern part of Milan also boasts the "Arco della Pace," resembling Paris's Arc-de-Triomphe, built to celebrate Napoleon's entry into Milan. These sites are well worth a visit.

Santanu had heard much about **Lake Como** from his old colleague, *Antonio*, who hailed from the area. Countless descriptions sparked a curiosity to visit Lake Como, renowned for bordering the southern part of Switzerland. These lakes are famous tourist destinations, offering tranquility to the rich and famous, including bankers, fashion designers, and Hollywood stars seeking lakeside properties. In the past, these lakes were reliable modes of transport to the higher Alps from the southern end.

A mere half-hour from the bustling Milan, Lake Como presents a magical blend of lush Mediterranean foliage and snowy alpine peaks. We strolled along the classic lakeside promenade, with narrow and congested roads lined by old villas (some converted into hotels). From there, we took a ferry ride to **Bellagio** on the southern shore, often referred to as the pearl of the lake.

The ferry ride was enchanting, passing by other small villages along the lakeside, easily accessible. Bellagio, with its narrow cobbled streets, breathtaking views, small homes, and glorious villas, exuded charm through winding alleys, flowering balconies, and lace-curtained windows.

> If your legs feel weak, consider taking a cab or bus from the train station to the lakefront instead of walking.

In recent times, two blockbuster movies, "STAR WAR â€“II" and "Ocean Twelve," were filmed here.

Despite the village not being overly crowded with tourists, we regretted leaving this captivating place, as we had already booked a hotel in Milan. The train journey from Milan to Como was pleasant but overshadowed by the memory of the lake's natural beauty and that magical afternoon on the ferry. Upon returning, we had dinner at one of the restaurants near Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, which was scrumptious.

> Given the long summer days, an afternoon ferry ride is a better option. This way, you can use the first part of the day for exploring other attractions. Enjoy the afternoon sun on the ferry for a sun-tan. However, if you embark too late in the afternoon, you might miss the opportunity for a round-trip ferry ride.
