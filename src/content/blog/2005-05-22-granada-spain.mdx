The temperature in Spain soared, a stark contrast to the relatively cooler Paris. Arriving in Granada in the scorching afternoon, the mercury hit around 37°C. While the intercity bus station wasn't centrally located, efficient public transport connections made the journey to our hotel at Plaza Royal hassle-free.

Venturing out around 5 PM, the heat and brightness persisted. Our stroll led us towards Plaza Nueva, exploring two charming churches along the Darro River with intricate woodwork. Continuing uphill, we reached St. Nicolas Church in El Albaicín, perched on a hilltop offering a breathtaking view of the Alhambra at sunset. The narrow cobblestone roads and vibrant atmosphere made it a captivating experience, with tourists and lively gypsies selling art and playing music.

With time to spare before sunset, we descended a bit to explore Sacromonte, home to gypsy caves, some preserved for historical and tourist purposes. Returning to The Church of San Nicolás, a spot even graced by Bill Clinton during his presidency, we marveled at the reddish hues of the Alhambra against the evening sky.

Reflecting on the day, we acknowledged the potential loss of photos due to issues with the Smart Card Media. Fortunately, the memories were recovered, preventing what could have been a somber moment.

And, credit where it's due, the vegetarian restaurant recommended by Rick Steve turned out to be a satisfying choice for dinner.
