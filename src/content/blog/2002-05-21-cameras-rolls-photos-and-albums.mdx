If you've stumbled upon my corner of the internet, Thank You for visiting. 

Most of my Web Site is dedicated to photography. In fact, the very thought of sharing pictures has changed with the internet. I like to see pictures in print myself. But when you have friends halfway across the globe, the internet is your best friend. The pictures in these albums are taken by three different cameras. 

The first camera I had was a Pentax. Now I have a Nikon N-80 and recently bought a Digital camera from Olympus. In fact, I liked all of them and I am very much impressed with their results. I used Yahoo!, Ofoto, and Nikon club to share my pictures. But the problem is they all are great in their own way. I spent a good deal of time myself to organize all the albums so that I have the same look for all the pictures.
