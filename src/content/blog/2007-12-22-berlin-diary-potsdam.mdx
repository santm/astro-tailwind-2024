### 2005 March Easter Weekend

Today, the sun and clouds play tag across the skies along the shores of Berlin as it glides past. We decided to visit Potsdam city, situated to the southwest of Berlin, known for Sanssouci (without worries) palace. We reached there by train.

Given our time constraints with the return ticket to Paris the same evening, we opted for a sightseeing guided tour bus available right outside the train station. Along with other tourists, we visited the new palace, old town hall, Fortunaportal, and Nikolaikirche at Alter Markt, Schloss Cecilienhof, Potsdam’s Brandenburg gate, Dutch colony, and Russian colony Alexandrowka, providing a flair of a city steeped in European tradition. Last but not least was Sanssouci palace, where we left the guided tour bus as it was their last stop. We spent quite some time in the Sanssouci garden, a terraced vineyard on the southern side, from where we walked down to the railway station.

Upon returning, we found that even Berlin had a sunny day. Without wasting time, we hopped on bus no. 100 to capture shots of historical sights against the backdrop of a blue sky. After a late lunch, we returned to the hotel to collect our luggage. After a bit of relaxation, Santanu enjoyed a beer at the cheapest price (compared to Paris) at home to the country’s largest brewers.
