From this Monday, I moved to a corner desk, bringing in a new pair of shoes to mark the change in my work environment. The desk is pleasant, but I can't help but miss the [view from the window](http://blog.santm.com/2007/04/13/little-visitor-at-office-window/). However, this post isn't about my office or work.

Our boss is currently sailing in the Far East, and to honor him, we had a dinner at [Marine Plaza Hotel](http://www.hotelmarineplaza.com/). The hotel's location is superb, and as we were a large group, we secured a hall with a view of the Black Bay and Marine Drive of Mumbai. This windswept promenade is the crown jewel of Mumbai's attractions. If you find yourself in Mumbai, consider this location for an evening dinner - there are plenty of high-end hotels to choose from.

The food was good, although not excellent; it was a buffet with a variety of salads, soups, and Indian snacks. I had little room left for the main course after indulging in those, but I made sure to save enough space for dessert. There were around 10 different types, and you can see I loaded almost all of them onto my plate. I can't recall any of those fancy names, but the chef's delight was the ultimate one. I was a bit skeptical when taking the big white dessert; it had a layer of chocolate in the middle to make it even more delicious.

Confessing with my palm stretched and flat on the keyboard, I acknowledge my sweet tooth. No big secret, I love **desire** might be a better one to express my feeling for them,  desserts - particularly **chocolates**. I have a penchant for dark chocolate, but I can't consume enough of them in one go. Unfortunately, I'm not getting my daily dose of chocolate as I used to have after dinner in Paris. In Paris, you can even find 100% chocolate with a warning on the wrapper that the taste might be too strong. Chocolates from mainland Europe, especially from France, Switzerland, and Belgium, are the best. The only chocolate I know and like from Italy is Ferrero Rocher – well, enough about chocolates for this post…but never enough for my tongue.
