Every Sunday evening, I find myself eagerly waiting for the middle of the week—Wednesday—since the next weekend seems too distant. If there's a special occasion planned for Wednesday evening, it significantly lifts my spirits. Last Wednesday turned out to be such an occasion when Pamela surprised me with a call at work, announcing her plan to come to VT (CST) all by herself, boarding a local train for the first time. Special thanks to Meher for encouraging Pamela to make the trip in the first place.

Pamela did experience a bit of panic during the last leg of her journey, finding herself alone in the wagon with two transsexuals sitting beside her. Furthermore, not seeing me at VT led to her venting her frustration over the phone, as I was supposed to meet her there. It's true; I always seem to get entangled in work or urgent phone calls whenever I need to be on time to meet her. To add to it, her phone battery was running low. Despite these challenges, we managed to meet without much trouble, but I'm not skilled enough as a writer to embellish that meeting. Anyway, as per plan, we met Meher in front of GPO and headed to Kala-Ghoda via cab.

**Kala-Ghoda** is a crescent-shaped plaza nestled around heritage buildings like Elephantine College, the David Sassoon Library, and the Watson Hotel. Named after a long-gone statue of King Edward VII astride a black horse, this plaza in South Mumbai is fast emerging as the arts hub of downtown Bombay. Meher, being born and brought up in South Mumbai, knows the streets like the back of her hand. After walking across all those gorgeous office buildings from bygone years, we reached Horniman Circle Park, where the French rock band **Merzhin** was set to perform for the Kala-Ghoda festival organized by **Alliance Française**, Mumbai. This festival aims to improve the existing infrastructure of the area, giving it a distinct identity as Mumbai's art district. It brings together works from various fields like arts, theater, film, music, literature, dance, heritage walks, exhibitions, and children's events, offering an interactive cultural melange for Mumbaikars.

The introduction from the director had a very "French" touch, as he stated, "If you want a good life, learn French." A rather snobbish yet intriguing French way of welcoming the audience. I must share a noteworthy experience—the concert was enjoyed while sitting on chairs! A rock concert with seating! The band was good, and they tried their best to get people rocking, but it didn't quite work, especially with an Indian audience on a Wednesday evening.

An hour later, we left for dinner, and after walking two blocks, we found ourselves in front of **Café Mocambo**. The café features two levels of seating; the interior is decent but not stunning. The menu offers a mix of continental and Parsi dishes, with an array of pasta options to choose from. Additionally, lamb, steak, and lasagna are available. The establishment boasts a standard fridge displaying delicious desserts—a tempting sight! Many foreigners also frequent this café.
