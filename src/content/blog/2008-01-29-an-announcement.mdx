The announcement for this blog post has been long overdue. Although the breaking news was promptly shared with friends and family on the day itself through SMS and emails from the hospital, I made sure to bring along my camera, laptop, and wireless data card.

I designed two announcement cards, one in pink and the other in blue, featuring two names (for a girl and a boy) and had them ready. We deliberately kept this significant news under wraps on our blog for the past few months. In fact, it remained a secret to many, disclosed only to close family members and a select few friends. I promise to update the blog with the details of those tense and eagerly awaited events as the eight and a half months passed by. Regular readers of our blog may have noticed the absence of a travelogue in recent times.

Currently, life is a bit hectic as we navigate the art of wrapping (burrito-style) and changing diapers. I don't foresee myself staying up late in front of the computer for the next few months.

I've just uploaded a few pictures of Aarush, who has now completed 11 days. You can view them [here](http://aarush.santm.com/gallery3/).
