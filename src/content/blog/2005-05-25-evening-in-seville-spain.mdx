title: Evening in Seville - Spain
---
Returning from Cordoba around 4 PM in the scorching afternoon heat, our next task was to secure tickets for the upcoming journey from Seville to Lisbon. The experience, narrated in sweat and heat, was a hot ordeal that we quickly retreated from upon reaching our hotel.

After freshening up from the afternoon heat, our evening began with a leisurely stroll commencing from Puente de San Telmo towards Triana at around 9 PM, exploring the other side of the river, a typical Seville neighborhood. Along the way, the iconic 'Torre del Oro' caught our eyes. We later found ourselves in a bustling tapas bar, where servers meticulously recorded orders and prices on the desk in front of us, creating a lively atmosphere.

Around midnight, we departed Triana, unfortunately missing the chance to experience flamenco music during our entire trip. Nonetheless, we walked back near the cathedral, capturing a nighttime snapshot of the bell tower. Despite the late hour, the city remained vibrant, crowded with both tourists and locals, giving the impression that the night was still young.
