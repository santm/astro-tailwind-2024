The overnight bus journey from Seville to Lisbon was surprisingly brief. A one-hour stop at the Portuguese border allowed a glimpse into the early hours of the morning, still cloaked in darkness. A swift taxi ride from Lisbon's Oriental Stop to the Zoological Garden area, costing a mere 6 Euros, offered a brief conversation with a friendly driver who shared insights about Portugal's ongoing drought.

Arriving at the Novotel, amidst ongoing renovations, the accommodating staff provided us a room at 4:30 in the morning, even after realizing our booking mistake for just one adult.

Following a few hours of rest, we ventured into Lisbon's downtown via metro on a cloudy day. A heavy head called for a coffee fix, and after a stroll in Rossio Square, we acquired a day pass for Lisbon Transport.

Lisbon's downtown, divided into **Bairro Alto**, **Alfama**, and **Baixa**, presented a distinct charm. The exploration commenced with the Gloria funicular, providing a short, tourist-filled ride to the top of Bairro Alto. The stunning view from the hillside park, coupled with a nearby 'Porto' wine collection place, set the stage for a delightful descent toward Chiado.

Chiado, a vibrant hub with designer shops, eateries, and the exquisite Sao Roque Church, built during Portugal's glory days, offered an enriching experience. Lunch at a Baixa Chiado mall restaurant preceded a tram 28 journey to Alfama, passing through Baixa district.

Exploring the Castle of SÃ£o Jorge and taking in the panoramic views, we returned via tram 28 to Chiado, experiencing the Bica funicular's stiff descent to the riverfront. The worn, old buildings alongside added character to the journey.

Embarking on tram 15 towards Belem, a 5 km venture outside Lisbon, provided glimpses of the 25th April Bridge resembling San Francisco's Golden Gate, both constructed by the same company. Belem's attractions, including the tower, monastery, and the 'Monument to the Discoveries,' marked the day's historical highlights.

A return to Chiado for dinner concluded our extensive day of exploration before heading back to the hotel.
