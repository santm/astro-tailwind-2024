<Image src={pic1} alt="Singapore Sale"/>

I snapped this photo last Sunday during a quest to alleviate my dreary rainy afternoon with a cup of coffee at **Starbucks**. Singapore is currently in the midst of an ambitious project to saturate the city with hotspots, and it's currently in BETA testing. To join, you simply need to sign up with SingTel, StarHub, or M1 (not entirely sure about the last one), the three main wireless providers, while the back-end services are handled by iCell and Qmax Networks.

Known for its shopping centers, Singapore offers a unique glimpse into the exhaustion that can accompany a shopping spree. The image captures the weariness of a gentleman who decided to take a break on a Starbucks sofa after a shopping excursion at [Mustafa Centre](http://www.mustafa.com.sg/), a 24-hour shopping paradise in Little India. Frequented by locals and Indian tourists alike, it boasts a bustling weekend crowd of over 15,000 customers of various nationalities. While his companion was engrossed in her mobile phone, I seized the opportunity to take this photo, offering a candid view of post-shopping exhaustion (or perhaps an invasion of sleep, if not privacy). Personally, I often find myself complaining about sore feet and headaches during mall excursions but have yet to resort to such a dramatic repose.

> Sorry another image lost in many transition. Looks like lost picture was taken with mobile what ever that was those days.Posting a picture from same date but from Point&Shoot camera.
