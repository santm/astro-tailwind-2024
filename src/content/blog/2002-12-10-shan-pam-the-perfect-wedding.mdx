title: Shan & Pam-The Perfect Wedding
---

It was the 27<sup>th</sup> April 02,

Every thing was geared up for the Mumbai,

Our “Rosy” flower, made “Shan” like a bee humming,

Not showing outside, Pam thought it was her prince charming,

Santanu was convinced it was the end of his findings,

Gandhiji was nervously smiling,

Shan’s mother-in-law thought it was perfectly matching,

Pam’s mother and father-in-law were unable to hide the excitement,

Sensing wedding bells ringing,

Choton proposed an early ring exchanging,

Everyone on both sides was priding,

Thought it was a great timing,

Then came a series of e-mailing,

Thousands of miles kept two hearts parting,

While Technology brought California & Durg closing,

And the two did each other some measuring,

At Satna there were forgotten few, who were guessing,

When at Durg “The Great Jija” felt something missing,

Why his sali’s plum looks gave way to slim & beauty tantalizing,

8<sup>th</sup> Nov’02 kept them waiting and waiting,

14<sup>th</sup> Aug’02 traditional ring ceremony gave some consoling,

On 5<sup>th</sup> Nov’02, “Jija & Co” left Satna with a lot of worrying,

And the sight of his father suffering,

Believing everything will be OK till returning,

Only Shiva knew, Kolkata will be far from reaching,

When news at Gaya came like a bolt thundering,

Your father is no more, came a voice grieving.

The “Biye” at Kolkata started with Agni offerings,

Shudh Mantras, the Brahmin was reciting,

Santanu’s patience got some testing,

The “destined future “made home and parents from Rosy departing,

Hectic jaunts, (Kolkata to Siliguri to Durg and back to Kolkata) made both of them panting,

As Siliguri & Durg were places of “Chaturtha-mangal” and partying,

Finally, to California the two birds were flying,

But Hong Kong made them hopping,

The Album kept us waiting,

We opened to find “Shan & Pam –The perfect Wedding”
