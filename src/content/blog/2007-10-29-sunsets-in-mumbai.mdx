<Image src={pic1} alt="Picture from Balcony"/>

The late October sunset, painting the sky with shades of blue, is truly "magnifique." The open spaces of Navi Mumbai, as seen from a local train, create a captivating view (picture taken through the window).

This photo was captured last Saturday when I found myself in the midst of the JJ Flyover â€“ the longest flyover in Mumbai, stretching over 2.3 KM. The flyover's design resembles that of a snake, gracefully navigating through a labyrinth of old buildings on either side. Essentially, it provides a bypass over the busy and crowded market below. Some buildings along the way are so close that they almost seem to touch the flyover.
