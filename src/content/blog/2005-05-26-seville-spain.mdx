***Last day at Seville...*** After bidding farewell to our hotel, we hopped on a bus and disembarked near the Casino of Exposition. Unbeknownst to us, it was a public holiday in Seville, rendering the morning streets surprisingly quiet. Our destination was Plaza de Espana, constructed for the 1929 World Expo, where many Latin American countries participated. Unfortunately, the expo coincided with the onset of the Great Depression, marking it as a financial disaster.

The renowned Andalusian tile work graced Plaza de Espana, with maps of Spain, beautiful benches, and decorative bridges. We strolled through the grand corridors of the Spanish Pavilion, making our way to Alcazar while passing the university and a famous 5-star hotel, the former site of a cigarette factory.

Alcazar, once home to King Pedro Castile and Maria de Padilla, presented a stark contrast to the Alhambra, with its maze-like rooms and enchanting outside gardens. The day unfolded with a religious holiday, marked by processions around the cathedral. Our post-lunch retreat inside a caf√© served as a respite from the scorching heat.

A bus ride took us to the Basilica of Macarena, renowned for its weeping Mary. We retraced our steps back to Plaza de Espana, strategically timed to capture its west-facing charm in the evening light, perfect for photos.

Exhausted from our explorations, we opted for tapas dinner next to our hotel, relishing the street-side seating and cool breeze. The night concluded with a taxi ride to the bus stop for Lisbon, although the midnight bus wait lacked excitement. Despite the fatigue, the overnight bus ride turned out to be a tolerable journey.
