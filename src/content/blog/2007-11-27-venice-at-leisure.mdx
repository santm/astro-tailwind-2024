### 2004 June 

The following morning brought the joy of a clear blue sky after two days of gray overcast. Around 9:00 AM, we arrived by boat at the bustling St. Mark's Square. **St. Mark's Basilica**, influenced by Byzantine architecture, was teeming with crowds, making it challenging to explore at that time. Unfortunately, in the evening, we ran out of time and had to settle for admiring its exterior. **Doge's Palace**, a Gothic masterpiece with the iconic Bridge of Sighs at the rear, crafted from white limestone with windows adorned with stone bars, captured our attention. This bridge linked the old prisons to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace and served as the last viewpoint of Venice for convicts before their imprisonment. While the **Campanile bell tower** offered a panoramic city view, we decided to forgo the ascent as there was much more to discover. Visiting museums was a resounding "NO" due to time constraints.

We thoroughly enjoyed a trip along the enchanting **Grand Canal** with its convenient hopping-on and off options. Countless bridges connected Venice's neighborhoods, and we marveled at the sight of many historical buildings gradually sinking into the marshy ground, their structures tilting.

In the afternoon, post-lunch, we embarked on a cruise to one of the islands in the Venetian lagoon, namely **Murano**. Here, we witnessed the mesmerizing artistry of Venetian glass blowers crafting delicate objects renowned for their glassware, lamps, chandeliers, and glass jewelry. Our visit included a stop at the glass museum and a tour of a few glass factories, providing insight into their artistic process. We purchased a few souvenirs for friends and family.

As evening descended, we returned to the iconic **Rialto Bridge**, renowned for its charming shops. Comprising three bridges joined together, it presented a unique spectacle. While wandering around, we observed many opting for the classic **gondola ride**, albeit an expensive venture. Opting against it due to the unavailability of another couple to share the cost, we instead explored the route from Rialto to the Academia (one of the famous museums) and back to Piazza San Marco, winding through ornate squares.

> **TIPS:** Consider acquiring a travel pass for the elusive water bus, as single tickets might be less economical if planning to explore every nook and cranny over multiple days. Our exploration missed a few notable attractions, including the famous Opera house undergoing renovation, the unexplored beaches of Lido (where we stayed), and the acquisition of those iconic **carnival masks** for wall hanging.

Venice, it appears, is not just about pasta. Instead, we discovered the charm of **Cichetti** (chee-keht-tee), small portions of food served in bars across the city, accompanied by a small glass of wine. These delectable treats are enjoyed while standing in crowded rooms, although I, being not much of a wine enthusiast, couldn't partake in the full experience.
