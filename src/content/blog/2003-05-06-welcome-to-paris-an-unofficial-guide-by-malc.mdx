Here's a comprehensive guide to flat hunting, gathered from various sources. A quick note: Most of this is geared towards finding a flat on your own. Steer clear of [Hestia.fr](http://www.Hestia.fr) – tales of woe often originate there. Assemble your 'dossier' right away, including copies of your present employment contract, the last 3 pay slips, 3 rent receipts (or your 1-year mortgage statement from the UK, like in my case), utility bills, birth certificate (optional), passport, RIB (bank details), and last year's tax statement. It's like a competition – the fullest dossier wins the flat.

Sorting out a guarantor is crucial due to French tenant law. Landlords protect themselves in Paris by demanding a guarantor, usually a parent, on the French social security system. Foreigners might look to French friends, but it carries a stigma. Company guarantee is an option too.

For flat hunting, check out sites like [www.acheter-louer.fr](http://www.acheter-louer.fr), [www.locat.fr](http://www.locat.fr/), and [www.pap.fr](http://www.pap.fr/) (Des Particuliers a Particuliers). To share, try [www.coloc.fr](http://www.coloc.fr) or [www.bonjour.fr](http://www.bonjour.fr).

Navigating Paris? Use [www.maporama.com](http://www.maporama.com) or [www.mappy.fr](http://www.mappy.fr).

For furniture, check [www.ikea.fr](http://www.ikea.fr) and [www.conforama.fr](http://www.conforama.fr).

>Important notes: You pay the flat insurance; the difference between furnished and unfurnished rent is significant; notice periods and deposits vary; you pay all agency fees; unfurnished contracts are usually for 3 years, and furnished for 1 year; you can escape the contract without penalty if you leave the country.

If you're not fluent in French, use Babel fishbabelfish to translate. For eating and drinking spots, try [www.parispubs.com](http://www.parispubs.com) or [www.theauldalliance.com](http://www.theauldalliance.com).

Get used to Arrondissement numbers. The 1st is the center, winding out in a spiral to the 20th. Good areas include the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th, 15th. Consider buying; loan rates are reasonable, and purchasing is cheaper than renting.

Keep in mind, even after finding a place, paperwork takes at least 3 months to sort out. Happy flat hunting!
