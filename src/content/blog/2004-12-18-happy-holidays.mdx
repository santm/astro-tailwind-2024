**Happy Holidays!!!**

---------------------



Well year 2004 is almost over; wish you all the best for the year 2005

and next. This year we did not traveled like last year. But we did

traveled to Italy and Greece for one week each, other than some of few

short trips. You will find them in pictures for 2004.



In the month of November we framed few pictures and cross-stitch work of

Pamela. Here are the pictures of the same. The two flower pictures are

from Keukenhof trip. This is the first time we enlarged our pictures for

framing.
