title: Little Visitor at Office Window
---

It's Friday again, and I've already been at work for the past nine hours (reached around 8ish). Wow! that's a lot, and it's time to head home soon.

Today, after many failed attempts, I somehow succeeded in capturing a very **cute visitor** at my window. I have no idea what kind of bird this is, but I'm going to ask an expert for more information. Well, Pamela is working very hard to upload pictures from Goa and write trip details â€“ hope to have them uploaded this weekend.
