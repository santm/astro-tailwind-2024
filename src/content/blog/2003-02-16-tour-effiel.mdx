It was a bright and chilly winter day when we headed straight to the number one attraction in Paris, or you could say all of Europe. 

The view was fantastic, We asked a Japanese tourist to take our photo. Still rememeber him the way he was trying to capture us , that in itself was a picture.

There were many people from the Indian subcontinent selling cheap Eiffel Tower souvenirs. We didn't stay long, though. The day was just too cold and windy to go to the top of the tower.

P.S. Check out more pictures of this monument on other days here.
