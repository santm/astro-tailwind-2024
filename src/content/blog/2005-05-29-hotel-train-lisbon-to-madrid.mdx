title: Hotel Train Lisbon to Madrid
---

In the closing chapter of our vacation, we boarded the train bound for Madrid, where our flight back to Paris awaited us.

Our train tickets were secured well in advance, and I personally visited the inconspicuous Spanish Railway ticket office in bustling Boulevard Haussmann, a hidden gem amidst the lively shopping hub.

As Indians experiencing the intricacies of a Hotel Train, a unique experience awaited us. The night train connecting Lisbon and Madrid offered four ticket options. The chair car, the most economical choice, was followed by four-person cabins, categorized by gender. Next were two-person cabins, with the option of first class boasting an attached shower and toilet, while the other featured a personal washbasin. Operated by the Accor Hotel Group, one of Europe's largest hotel chains, these cabins exceeded our expectations.

Opting for a two-person cabin with a washbasin, we were pleasantly surprised by the hospitality and the cabin's comfort. Reflecting on our choice, we pondered the allure of the first-class cabins and wondered if the additional cost would have been worth it. Although first-class passengers enjoyed inclusive dinners and breakfasts, our fare only covered breakfast.

The enchanting experience of a train service often seen in Hindi movies became a reality for us. Perhaps, in a whimsical thought, our beloved Laloo-jee could one day travel in such luxury and introduce a similar service from Patna. A delightful dream indeed!
