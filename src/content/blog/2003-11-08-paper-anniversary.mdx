**Yes!!!** Its one year that we got married,the year was quite eventful
for both of us. On this day we went to [Ramkrishna
Mission](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/72157638608133085/).The
hour long train ride to outskirts of Paris was very scenic with fall
color.Winter was breathing on our neck with its chilly wind. Durga Pooja
and Diwali is just over, but celebrations in Paris goes on.We went to
**Salon du Chocolate.** It was some thing not to be missed. There were
chocolate stalls from all over the world and they were giving away so
many chocolate to taste for free.
