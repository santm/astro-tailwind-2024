**Yes!!!** Its one year that we got married,the year was quite eventful

for both of us. On this day we went to [Ramkrishna

Mission](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santm/sets/72157638608133085/).The

hour long train ride to outskirts of Paris was very scenic with fall

color.Winter was breathing on our neck with its chilly wind. Durga Pooja

and Diwali is just over, but celebrations in Paris goes on.We went to

**Salon du Chocolate.** It was some thing not to be missed. There were

chocolate stalls from all over the world and they were giving away so

many chocolate to taste for free.
