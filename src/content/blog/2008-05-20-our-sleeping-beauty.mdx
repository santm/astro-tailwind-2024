Aarush has never been a fan of sleep whenever we attempted to secure his hands... I mean, with a burrito wrap. If swaddled, he persistently moves his hands in discomfort until he's liberated. He always prefers having his hands free, stretched upward. These snapshots were captured during a half-hour catnap, showcasing the various positions of his two little hands. So many poses for those tiny hands!💪🏼 😄
