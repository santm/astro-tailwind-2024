I should have started jotting down all my memories from this beautiful city immediately after my return to Paris. But back to work and daily routine... lots of finer moments are fading off.

Taking a morning bus from Granada to Seville, we arrived around 11 AM after a 2-hour and 45-minute ride. From the IntercityBus stop to our hotel (again Novotel), we opted for the local public bus, getting off two stops early, leading to a pleasant walk along Seville's charming boulevard.

Arriving before the afternoon, we discovered that no non-smoking rooms were available. Leaving our luggage, we ventured to a nearby mall and opted for lunch at McDonald's. Surprisingly, the 99-cent burgers felt like a fine dining experience, possibly reflecting McDonald's efforts to reclaim its market share with revamped interiors.

Our sightseeing kicked off around 5 PM with the Cathedral of Seville, proudly featured in the Guinness Book of World Records. Having visited the Vatican and St. Paul in London, this cathedral left a lasting impression, showcasing the wealth and craftsmanship derived from the New World. The intricate details in wood, marble, glass, and the impressive Bell tower, the lone survivor from the old mosque, were truly remarkable.

Exiting the Cathedral, we wandered through the Santa Cruz district, an old part of the city with narrow lanes reminiscent of Vanaras and Calcutta. The lack of sunlight due to close-set houses made it cooler than the new city, dotted with charming parks and patios adorned with orange treesâ€”a signature of Andalusia, even if the oranges themselves are said to be bitter.

Seville's evenings are magical, with people strolling about, enjoying cool breezes and tapas. Despite the scorching afternoon temperatures, the city comes alive in the evening. We strolled along the Bridge of Triana, passing the bullfight arena, and indulged in a delightful Paella dinner before midnight, surrounded by a lively crowd.

On our way back to the hotel, we stumbled upon a crowded restaurant displaying tempting desserts by the window. Despite the lack of proper seating, we managed to secure two chairs, savoring the mouthwatering treats. A sweet conclusion to an unforgettable evening in Seville.
