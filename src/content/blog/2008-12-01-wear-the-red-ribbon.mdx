On December 1st, 2008, we observe World AIDS Day â€” a dedicated effort to raise awareness about one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Currently, 33 million people are HIV-positive globally, with a staggering 90% unaware of their status. These statistics underscore the urgent need to amplify awareness regarding the devastating effects of this incurable disease.

While there is ample online information for quick access, a significant challenge persists in uneducated rural areas. In these regions, AIDS is not merely underdiscussed; it is often entirely overlooked, hindering the possibility of a healthy dialogue.
