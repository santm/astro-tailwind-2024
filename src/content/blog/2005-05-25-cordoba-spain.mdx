When we initially planned our trip to Andalusia, Cordoba wasn't the first city on our list. However, the persuasive recommendations of friends who had previously explored its wonders convinced us otherwise.

Embarking on a journey from our bustling Seville hotel, we traversed the vibrant morning streets to reach the train station. Opting for the AVE (fast train) to Cordoba, we were pleasantly surprised by the cost, quite reasonable compared to the French standard, akin to a journey from Paris CDG airport to the city center. The swift and efficient train service whisked us away at high speeds, setting the tone for our Cordoba adventure.

Cordoba's main allure lies in its Mezquita (Mosque), a living testament to the city's transformation through various cultures and religions. Originally conceived by Moorish rulers in the 10th century, Cordoba was one of the first significant cities built during their reign. Initially a modest mosque, it expanded as the city flourished. The double arches with red and white stripes, though decorative, create an immense effect, a unique architectural marvel.

As the Christians took control of Cordoba, the mosque underwent minimal modifications, transforming into a church. The Mihrab, traditionally serving as a guide to Mecca and amplifying the prayers of the Imam, is intricately adorned with Islamic arts of gold on marble. Interestingly, the Cordoba Mosque Mihrab faces south, similar to the Damascus mosque, rather than southeast towards Mecca.

Wandering through Cordoba's charming streets, we explored its picturesque patios, with early May being the ideal time for a visit. The city hosts a competition for the most beautiful patio, resulting in a plethora of delightful options to explore.

Amid the scorching afternoon heat, we sought refuge near Alcazar with a light snack of fruits and juice. The relentless sun prompted us to wait patiently for a public bus, but the searing temperature led us to opt for a taxi back to the train station, a small price (4 Euros) to pay for the blissful respite of air-conditioned comfort from the 40-degree Celsius outdoor heat.
