title: Diwali at Paris
---
"Are you safe out there?" This was typical question to which I have been
answering to my friends and relatives after the riots at Paris suburbs.

I myself was keeping updated with news only. "Thank God" it looks like
getting better now. I would not like to make any comments and express my
view on the same as it seems to be very complex matter.

We celebrated Diwali quite well this year. On evening of 2nd oct. it was
at Vendanta Society of Paris(with puja).And on 5th it was at **Maison de
l'inde** with fireworks and cultural activities. But this year the biggest
celebration of Diwali was hosted by Mayor of Paris at “Hotel de Ville”
for the first time. It was an event by invitation. Unfortunatley, I
did not have enough social contacts to be there.
