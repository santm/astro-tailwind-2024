title: Courtesy still … in Mumbai
---

Amidst all the hustle and bustle of Mumbai's fast-paced life, I unexpectedly encountered courtesy within the Mumbai local—a surprising display of refined human behavior in this Maximum City. Seated on my journey from VT terminus, I considered myself fortunate to have found a spot.

In the midst of the journey, a family of three boarded the train. It's quite uncommon for a female passenger to enter the general or male compartment during rush hours. This unwritten yet well-defined code of conduct in Mumbai locals dictates that female passengers avoid the general compartment to prevent being squeezed by male passengers.

After a few moments of internal contemplation, I decided to offer my seat to the lady, signaling her husband. It was a relief for them, and both the mother and son were able to find a seat.

Suddenly, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder. Turning around, I saw another gentleman offering his seat to me as he was about to disembark. Normally, the person standing next to the seat has the rightful claim, and it's considered a significant "faux pas" if someone else takes the seat. This act was an acknowledgment of my good karma by a fellow passenger, leaving me astonished. In a city where everyone is ready to compete, this unexpected display of kindness is an experience that I'll likely cherish for a long time to come.
