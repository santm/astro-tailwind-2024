This picture was taken with my phone camera during our weekly vegetable shopping at APMC \[Agro Product Market\] near Vashi. Prices for every vegetable have gone up. Due to the lack of infrastructure, it was shameful to see so much wastage due to heavy rain. From the posture of the seller, it was quite clear that he was not expecting a lot of customers, as he stretched his back. There are protests against big retail chains as they have started selling Agro products in India. Although, with the entry of big retail players, it will take away the livelihood of lots of small businessmen, and prices will shoot up. But maybe with time, they will help us in saving the products from calamities like this with better infrastructure.
