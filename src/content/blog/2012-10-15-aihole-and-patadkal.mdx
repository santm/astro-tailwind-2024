## Day 3

After a hearty breakfast, we hit the road once more, this time following Pamela's Lumia GPS voice more attentively. With ease, we departed from Hospet and joined the wide, newly expanded NH-13 highway towards Bijapur. The drive was a pleasure, with sparse traffic and the trucks keeping to the left lane. Cruising at a comfortable 110/120 KMph, we soon reached Hungund. There, we took a left turn, heading towards Aihole.

### Aihole's Hidden Gems

Upon reaching Aihole, we were welcomed by the charm of a rustic village. Surprisingly, there were no guides or locals approaching us for assistance. In our confusion, we unintentionally passed through the village and found ourselves at the isolated Jain Temple located on the backside of a hill.

Returning to the village, we explored the lesser-known but captivating sites, including the **Hucchappayya Math Complex**, **Mallikarjuna Complex**, **Ravana Pahdi**, and **Hucchimalli Temple Complex**. While Aarush enjoyed a light snack in the shade of a tree, the scorching sun persisted, and we found ourselves the sole visitors at these remarkable places.

### Durga Temple Complex

Our next stop was the **Durga Temple Complex**, the main attraction of Aihole. This time, we were fortunate to find a guide, and after a bit of negotiation, we enlisted his services. Over 90 minutes, he unveiled the historical and architectural marvels of the complex. if you look closely at the temple you will find resemblance with our parliament in New Delhi. 

Aihole holds a special place in the history of Karnataka, as it is considered the birthplace of the state's stone sculpture and construction traditions. It was here that individuals, inspired by the grandeur of Ellora, began their enduring love affair with stone craftsmanship.

### Journey to Patadkal

From Aihole, we continued our journey towards Patadkal. The road transformed into a typical village path, and the relentless sun beat down upon us. We reached Patadkal around 15:00, having skipped a proper lunch due to the absence of suitable stops along the way. In the comfort of our car, we snacked on the finger foods & fruits we had  with us.

### Patadkal's UNESCO Heritage

Upon our arrival at the UNESCO Heritage site in Patadkal around 15:30, the lengthening shadows offered some relief from the sun's intensity. We engaged a guide, without whom the true beauty and history of this place might have remained in mystery. Patadkal boasts seven temples, primarily dedicated to Lord Shiva. Unfortunately, only one of them remains functional, as the others suffer from broken or missing idols. The allure of Patadkal lies in its unique fusion of South and North Indian temple architecture. Just outside the main temple complex, we made a quick stop at the lone Jain temple on our right-hand side.

### The Road to Badami

The drive to Badami was a picturesque one, with the orange sunlight casting a warm glow against the backdrop of hills. The rocks seemed to radiate in the soft, golden light. We reached Badami before sunset and ordered some coffee and snacks upon our arrival at **Badami Court Hotel**.

Dinner was a simple affair, and after a long and eventful day, we retired to our beds early, eager for the adventures that awaited us on the next leg of our journey.
