Last weekend, I was in Bangalore, checking the progress on the construction site. Well, will this be the view if we move there? Unfortunately, at work, things are not yet crystal clear for the upcoming move. They say it's a nice view to have from the kitchen; after all, a happy person always makes a happy meal.

With the new Bangalore airport set to be operational next month, this side of town is expected to experience a surge in traffic, adding more worries for the already concerned Bangaloreans. The only hope is that the government takes proper steps for the speedy execution of the promised new public transport. However, judging by the current progress card, it seems like it is still 6-7 years away.
