Another year has passed, and more grey hairs to take care of now. This time, I cut the cake at the office with my team. The cake, of course, came from Cake Walk. I never had any birthday resolutions, and there was no difference this year as well. A big thanks to those who wished me on time or belatedly. For others, this post is a few weeks old in itself.
