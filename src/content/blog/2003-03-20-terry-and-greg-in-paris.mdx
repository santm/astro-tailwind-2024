title: Terry and Greg in Paris
---

So, Terry, aka "long hair" or the Canadian, made his way from Palo Alto to Paris. It was really cool of Terry, Jaroline (Terry's wife), and Greg to hang out with us for two evenings. It felt great to have friends around while enjoying a meal. The highlight was Terry getting a haircut in Paris at the end of his trip â€“ quite a big change, though I regret not having a camera to capture the moment.

Now, it's time to bid farewell to them, much like the others we left back in the Bay Area. Hoping to cross paths with this crazy "F***" guy somewhere down the line. Until then...
