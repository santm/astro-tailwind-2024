Back to Paris after a nice and quick vacation of 4 weeks from India. The

days passed by very quickly between meals and sleep. Our vacation got

split between my parents and in-law's house. But it was great to spent

time with family. Will post some new pictures and others later. Paris is

very beautifully decorated for holidays, it is a great sight to see all

those big trees along the road being lighted up, as they don't have any

leaf now.
