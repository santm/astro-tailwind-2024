title: Back from vacation
---
Back to Paris after a nice and quick vacation of 4 weeks from India. The
days passed by very quickly between meals and sleep. Our vacation got
split between my parents and in-law's house. But it was great to spent
time with family. Will post some new pictures and others later. Paris is
very beautifully decorated for holidays, it is a great sight to see all
those big trees along the road being lighted up, as they don't have any
leaf now.
