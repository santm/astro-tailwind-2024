First time we went to sign the lease. They asked me to write cheque of

almost 3000. Oh!!but I didn't had French cheque book yet & there was no

money in the account either. What a shame!!! No one told me. So I went

back to work and found I will be paid only once a month here. Need to

wait till month end.So after a week I came with the cheques and got the

keys of the apartment.
