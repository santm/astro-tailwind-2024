Thinking back to 2008, it was an eventful year. We kicked it off by welcoming a new member into our family, a moment filled with apprehension and excitement. Our world now revolved around the new addition, with countless diaper changes, sleepless nights, cries, and all the intricacies of parenthood.

Pamela's parents were in Mumbai to lend us a helping hand during these challenging yet happy times. Aarush, not even two months old, left Mumbai for Pamela's hometown, where they braved a scorching summer in Durg, with temperatures soaring up to 47 ºC.

In May, I relocated to Bangalore while continuing with the same company. Domestic relocation proved to be a Herculean task, managing everything from finding an apartment to dealing with movers, closing or transferring various accounts and establishments. My international relocation experiences seemed like a piece of cake in comparison.

In June, Aarush had his [rice ceremony at Siliguri](), an elaborate event similar to a Bengali marriage – exhaustive, yet full of fun and festivity. After the ceremony, the three of us headed directly to Bangalore. The journey from Durg to Siliguri and then to Bangalore via Calcutta each time marked Aarush's first long trip, where he got a taste of both train and flight travel.

Even before settling properly, within a month, I had to travel to Singapore for a three-week business trip in September. Pamela managed admirably with Aarush on her own.

In October, we traveled back to Siliguri to attend a [family marriage]() for a week.

By November, we started to get familiar with Bangalore and its [surroundings](). Initially, Aarush used to get uncomfortable after a 30-minute drive, but now he has grown accustomed to it and enjoys the rides.

Two weeks before, we visited [Mysore]() and [Coorg](). It was a great escape with a change of scenery, and Aarush behaved exceptionally well during his first night at a hotel. This vacation was perfect as we had no pre-set agenda; we moved and stopped as we wished.

As we approach the one-year milestone of parenthood, we reflect on these moments. Throughout the year, I faced new challenges on the professional front. The world economic news is yet to bring good tidings for all of us.
