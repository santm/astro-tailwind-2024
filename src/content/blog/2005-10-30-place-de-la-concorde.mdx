After a long time I was able to

capture the fountain of **Place de la Concorde**< in a very beautiful sunny morning. It is

so amazing that we still take pictures of Paris like tourist on their

first day. When we left home it was cloudy and we were questioning

ourselves why we are carrying the camera with us. But luckily it was

worth to do so. Then from there we took a small promenade at the garden

of Elysee.



  



While walking in 5th arrondissement we saw preparation for a big

renovation is going on at Madame Curie University (Jussieu) as they used

asbestos as insulator, But with high risk of cancer now government is

trying to get rid of the same. It has unique architectural plan which

resembles as a molecular matrix where each column is numbered. Looking

at the same you can like it or hate it there can not be any middle

opinion about the same.
