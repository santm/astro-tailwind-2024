Migrated to [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org/) along with

[Gallery2](http://gallery.menalto.com/), the choice for the same was not

easy. As for a long time [Mambo](http://www.mamboserver.com/) and custom

home grown Photo Album was doing the job fine. In fact the template I

used for the same was appreciated by friends. But as days passed and

numbers of pictures are growing it was getting difficult to manage the

same with custom gallery. But the idea to grab Wordpress and dropping

Mambo is a personal one. I will not compare the two. The fact is they

two are different and just I felt like

[blog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) software will be a better

choice for a personal website compared to a

[CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_System)



Well there is lots of lots work left to organize the pictures now after

this migration as there was no tool or script that I could use to

automate the same :(  Hope to finish this by end of September.
