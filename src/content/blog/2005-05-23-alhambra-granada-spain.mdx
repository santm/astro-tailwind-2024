Arriving in Granada without pre-booked tickets for Alhambra posed a potential challenge, considering the daily limit of 8,000 visitors. Fortunately, with the majority already secured through online reservations, our decision to rise early and join the morning queue on a Monday paid off, given it wasn't the peak of the tourist season.

Alhambra unfolds into four main sites, with the centerpiece being the **"Palacios Nazaries,"** hailed as the best-preserved Moorish Palace in Europe. Unscathed by the historical conflicts between Christians and Moorish forces that concluded in 1429, the palace captivated us with the intricate works of Moorish artists. While some liken it to the Taj Mahal, having not visited the latter, I reserve judgment, though the Moorish artistry stands on its own.

Immersing ourselves in Palacios Nazaries, we meandered through the enchanting garden of roses to reach Generalife. The journey continued to the 'Palace of Charles V' and 'Alcazaba,' completing our exploration of Alhambra's attractions.

Post-siesta, we explored the Cathedral, savoring the cultural richness of the area. An evening stroll led us to the delightful discovery of **"Chile Grande,"** a Mexican restaurant whose excellent cuisine transported us back to fond memories of Californian days.
