title: Summer 2002

Summer of 2002 was a great summer. I did lots of traveling. Thanks to
Tanujoy and Atul for the same. With Atul and I went to Utah for 4 day
trip in July, it was  great!. We visited four national parks and
traveled through very scenic highways.

I went to Yosemite few times for hiking and climbing with members of
[PGVIP](http://www.pgvip.net) and with other friends as well.
