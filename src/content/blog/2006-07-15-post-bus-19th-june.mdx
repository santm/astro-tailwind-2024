title: Post Bus - 19th June

As we embark on today's adventures, our destination remains uncertain. Montreux, the nearest attraction, hovers on our radar, but its proximity to Lausanne has us contemplating saving it for the last day. After a hearty breakfast, we find ourselves at the railway station, seeking information on the Swiss travel pass and the renowned Swiss Post Bus.

The yellow Swiss post bus system promises a breathtaking experience, connecting remote places in Switzerland inaccessible by train. While armed with printouts from various websites, none seemed tailored to Lausanne. Caught in the allure of the Napoleon route from Saas Fee to Locarno, we discover the special tourist post bus operates infrequently, requiring reservations.

Armed with a newly acquired Swiss Flexi Pass, we board a train to Visp. The journey is a visual feast, offering a taste of the Alps and their majestic mountain ranges. The bus ride from Visp to Saas Fee is nothing short of magnificent. Although we initially aimed for the Glacier Express, the special train eludes us, allowing just a fleeting 20 minutes in Saas Fee, aptly named the pearl of the Alps. A local invites us to the "little Himalaya of Europe," where we enjoy a takeaway lunch.

The return journey takes us to Brig, presenting a choice between a train and a bus. The train heads south via a long tunnel, while the bus opts for a longer route through Simplon Pass to a remote Italian village. From there, a train will ferry us to today's final destination, Locarno.

Despite uncertainties and Santanu's insistence on the more uncertain bus option, the journey through Simplon Pass at an elevation of almost 2005m above sea level is nothing short of breathtaking. As we reach the border station, only two passengers remain from the bus. Transferred to a mini-van with just one co-passenger, the wait for the bus in the absolute no-man's-land of Italy becomes an unexpected adventure.

In the midst of this quandary, our last leg to Locarno turns into a memorable experience, thanks to two kind-hearted Swiss individuals who come to our rescue. In summary, traversing the most beautiful Alpine passes via road, with views of snow-covered mountains, winding valleys, lakes, and picturesque villages, is an amazing experience.
