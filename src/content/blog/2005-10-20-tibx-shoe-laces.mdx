title: Tibx Shoe Laces
---
Yes these are my dirty shoes. Not very sure about the origin of those shoe laces, I got them when my old office was getting closed. Missing the TIBX bus and shares I got those laces ðŸ˜’ People got nice race cars and big houses in Bay Area a dream come true in this materialistic world and what I got for boarding the train late. Well I have another pair of these lacesâ€¦..
  
Unless any big shoot TIBX one day decide to run a charity marathon with these laces on his gizmo running shoes there is no real value to the other pair of laces I have. Any one out there â€¦. You know I am sure it will not cost much.
