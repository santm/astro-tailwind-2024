title: Seasons and the Elm tree
---

Here stand the lonely elm tree  
Rooted to the ground  
While its young little leaves swing free  
In the cool breeze that blows around 

Now Lo, behold!  
Here comes the wonderful summer  
Life abounds!  
The  ground is lush and lime green   
A glorious leaves of parakeet green  
Against the clear blue sky  

Now Lo behold!  
Here comes the ghostly winter   
Where no life is seen   
The weather is a bully; wicked, harsh and mean  
Where only the Ravens cry   
The tree lies naked, its green lustre gone   
Just bare wood, merely just wheat brown 
Against the deathly grey atmosphere  

Now lo behold!  
Here comes the rejuvenating spring  
The leaves are back  
A new lease on life  
Freed from the ice   
The grass dots the former barren lithosphere  
That surrounds the lonely elm tree
