title: Moved to Paris
---
After basking in the Bay Area for the last 4 years, we moved to Paris.
My dear friends from Bay Area Mandal, Subhajit and Tapas were kind enough to drop us at the SFO Airport. 
Somehow our flight was not a direct one to Paris. We we flew to London and then after a short stop over at Hethrow. *Somehow the airport was very unappeling one for stop over, where you need to spent some time*. May be, I was spoiled by Singapore. 

The flight from London to Paris was just 40 minutes or so. Very cold weather wise and the vive inside the plain. 

We landed afternoon time in Paris CDG (Charles de Gaulle) The weather was bleak and cold, almost blowing us off as we got into the taxi at the airport. We reached the hotel without any problems, thanks to a Chinese female driver who spoke English.

We checked inside the a tiny service apartment/hotel in Courbevoie which is just outside of Paris by defination but very close to my new office. 

Exhausted and tired, I aimed to reach work, which seemed like a 5-minute walk from the hotel on the map. However, I got lost in the concrete jungle of **La Défense**, one of the unique places with concentrated modern high-rise buildings in Europe. Without realizing it, I stumbled upon **La Grande Arche**, which was right in front of my nose.

After asking several people and, finally, the police, I still couldn't find my way to work that evening. And somehow returned back to hotel.
