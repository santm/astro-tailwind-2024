# Glimpses from My Window: A Pause Amidst the Hustle

Currently gazing out of my office window, the sight of **Ballard Pier** in South Bombay unfolds. The bustling activity of the **Bombay port**, amongst the busiest in India, if not the busiest, is a constant spectacle. The weather, as depicted in the photo, is still cast in gloom, characterized by ominous dark clouds—a capture from the early days of our Canon G7 camera. What draws my admiration in this picture is the interplay of light and shadow on the tree branches, presenting a well-centered and balanced shot.

However, let's not digress; this isn't a post about my office window or the camera itself. It's a brief escape from the demands of grueling work, a moment to share a quick update with all of you. I must applaud **Pamela's** dedicated efforts in enhancing the aesthetics, ergonomics, and accessibility of our blog. She's diligently categorized each post—big **kudos** to her, and be sure to check out the sidebar for the organized layout.

On another note, I'll be heading to **Bangalore** next week for a three-day official trip. While the possibility of relocating to Bangalore looms on the horizon for next year, I look forward to catching up with relatives and friends during my visit. Schedules permitting, of course. Until next time—bonne weekend!
