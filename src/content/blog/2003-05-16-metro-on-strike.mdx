title: Metro on Strike
---
It all kicked off on Tuesday the 13th. My manager kindly gave me a lift to work. Choosing a different path on my way back, I opted for a long but pleasant walk through **Bois de Boulogne**.

Come Wednesday, the strike, which was supposed to end, continued in true French fashion. Determined to overcome the transportation hurdle, I worked hard to fix my bike and pedaled my way to work. Unfortunately, this effort left me with a persistent shoulder ache, making sleep a rare commodity for the entire week. The strike persisted until Friday.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Murly, realizing the absence of public transport, embarked on a two-hour walk to reach work. Luckily, someone showed him a shorter route on the way back.

Thursday brought a decision for Pamela, who, after missing two classes, opted to trek across Paris to her French school, a journey that took an hour and a half. The return trip wasn't much fun for her either.

Finally, on Friday, things started looking up, and by Saturday, the strike had come to an end, at least for the time being. The saga of overcoming transportation woes during the strike week came with its share of adventures and challenges.
