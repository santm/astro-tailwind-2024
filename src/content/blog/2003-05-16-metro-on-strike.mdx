It started on Tuesday the 13th. My manager gave me a lift to work. On

the way back I walked, it was long but nice walk through **Bois de

Boulogne**Wednesday, the strike was supposed to end; but it continued in

a French way. So, I have to work hard to fix my bike and went by bike to

work. In that process I got an ache on to my shoulder, which did not

allow me to sleep for a whole week. And the strike continued till

Friday. On Wednesday, Murly after realizing that there is no public

transport, he walked 2 hours to reach work. On the way back some one

showed him a shorter route.Thursday, Pamela after missing two classes

decided to go to her French school and walked across Paris, which took

her one and half-hour to reach only. Returning was not a fun for her

either.On Friday things started getting better and on Saturday it ended

for now.
