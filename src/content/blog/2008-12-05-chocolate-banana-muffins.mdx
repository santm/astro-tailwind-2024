The first weekend of December passed by with a flurry of activities — a trip to Commercial Street, malls, and a brief visit to the office. On Saturday, Aarush insisted on an early start, depriving me of the luxury of extended weekend sleep. The morning was spent mostly attending to him, especially during breakfast. Lately, he has developed a rather inconvenient habit of prolonged (around an hour or more) eating times, be it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Afterward, he played for a while but soon became sleepy for a nap, creating an opportunity for me to try a muffin recipe that had long been on my to-do list.

I quickly searched for a "chocolate banana muffin" recipe and found [this one](http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/15298/choc+chip+banana+muffins), which I decided to follow with a few modifications. I began by beating powdered sugar with melted butter. In the meantime, I let two eggs come to room temperature. I mixed one teaspoon each of leveled baking soda and baking powder into the flour, sieving it 3-4 times to ensure enough air was incorporated. Then, I whisked the eggs and added milk. After mashing the banana in the grinder, I combined all three mixtures.

I alternately added half of the dry and liquid ingredients to the sugar-butter mixture, stirring in the chocolate last. Once the tray was in the oven, to my surprise and delight, the muffins started rising nicely. The best part of the entire exercise was the quick yet successful result — it only took 40 minutes to prepare and clean up the kitchen. It might take much less if you are prepared; in my case, it was all impromptu, from searching for the recipe to placing it in the oven. Anyway, after a long time, I enjoyed my time in the kitchen — thanks to Aarush for his nap :)

> P.S. You may add a little more sugar if you prefer sweeter muffins.
