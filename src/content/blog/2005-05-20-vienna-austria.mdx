We've just wrapped up uploading the photos from our Vienna escapade onto our site. The trip was fantastic, with one minor hiccupâ€”the hotel. "Novotel" turned out to be situated far from the city center, lacking proper public transport. We chose it based on our positive experiences in Amsterdam and Berlin. Despite the promise of a nearby metro station during booking, reality struck with a metro station 5 or 6 kilometers away, served by a bus running every one or two hours.

Arriving late at 11 PM, we opted for a cab from the airport to the hotel, initially quoted at 35 euros. To my dismay, it ended up costing us 54 euros. Fuming at the seemingly longer route, I confronted the hotel, only to find out that the normal fare was around 60 euros, a slight consolation.

Saturday led us to Melk by train, graced by a splendid day with a clear sky and warm temperatures. The train journey offered picturesque views of Austria's countryside. Melk boasted a stunning abbey, locally known as Stift, and a delightful boat ride on the Danube to Kermes. A chance encounter with a lady from Graz inspired a potential future visit to her picturesque Alpine town.

Returning to Vienna that evening, we strolled around StephansPlatz and savored a vegetarian meal in a quaint eatery. Sunday kicked off with coffee and delectable pastries, followed by a leisurely walk along the ring, taking in Vienna's iconic landmarks. The day included an enchanting visit to St. Augustine's Church for Sunday Choir, offering a unique and soothing musical experience.

Post-lunch, we explored the Belvedere Palace on a special day, commemorating Austria's 50 years of Freedom. Live music, various dance performances, and outdoor festivities added an extra layer of enjoyment.

Our final day was dedicated to Schonbrunn Palace, the summer residence of royalty. The exquisite park surrounding the palace demanded ample time to explore its lush greenery.

And just like that, our Vienna adventure concluded as we headed back to the airport for our afternoon flight to Paris.
