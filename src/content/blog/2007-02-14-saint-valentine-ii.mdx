As I mentioned [earlier](/blog/2007-02-14-saint-valentine/), numerous thoughts crossed my mind despite my busy schedule. Initially, I suggested to Pamela that she join me for lunch at *Fort area*, but she declined, citing pending household chores. Undeterred, I adjusted my plan and invited her for dinner, only to be informed that without a prior reservation, securing a table at a good restaurant on that particular day would be challenging—a valid point, indeed.

Despite her initial refusal, I remained hopeful, assuring her that we would go somewhere for sure. As time passed, my work commitments intensified, keeping me occupied for extended hours. Eventually, I nearly gave up on the idea of dining out. However, around seven, I managed to complete my work and headed home, arriving at half-past nine. Considering the need for a shower and preparation time, another 30 minutes elapsed. By the time we got into the car, it was already ten, prompting us to decide on having dinner at **Bombay Blues, Center-One - Vashi**.

Upon reaching the restaurant, the doorman informed us with a smile that obtaining a seat would take a minimum of 40 minutes. Undeterred, we took a stroll around nearby shops. Even after 40 minutes, luck did not favor us, and we continued waiting at the door. Finally, after 11, we secured a seat, leading to the next challenge—placing an order in the bustling and crowded environment. By around 11:40, something arrived on our plates.

Opting for the *Chicken sizzler*, the presentation appealed to my hungry stomach, but the taste was far from satisfying. Chinese food with cheese was an unexpected combination. Somehow, I managed with Pamela's plate and the appetizer.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson—never go for dining without a prior reservation, or it's preferable to enjoy and savor food at home, especially on Valentine's Day. Such occurrences can be attributed to the new economic growth that the Indian higher middle class is currently experiencing, with establishments across various sectors capitalizing on the trend, from mega-malls to jewelers, flower shops, and even food stalls.
