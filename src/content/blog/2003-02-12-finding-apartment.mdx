title: Finding Apartment
---

It was time to find a roof in Paris. However, this day marked our first real exploration of the city. We had only been in Paris for five days, and the relocation lady started by showing us a very, very disappointing apartment. She continued showing options until we finally found one within our budget, despite its numerous discomforts.

Pamela was quite skeptical about this place, but after thorough calculations, we somehow reached an agreement on it.

We started with something in 17th arrondissement, then moved to 9th and 11th and then 16th followed by 15th.
Relly do not remember all the places as we moved in a car. It was a comlete cultural shock - we just followed that lady.  

>According to my colleagues I am getting to a life less part of Paris. The quoted part is very funny I am not sure if you are going to appreciate this or not but here it is. “However, the 16th and 17th are only good if you happen to like little old ladies wearing fur and dragging ratty little dogs around (you know, the types with tartan jackets and yap lots, constitute a light bite for a proper dog).”
