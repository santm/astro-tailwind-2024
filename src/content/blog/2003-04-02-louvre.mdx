Having discovered that many museums offer free entry on the first Sunday of every month, we kicked off our museum tour with none other than the **Louvre**. And let me tell you, it's practically a museum in itself â€“ I'm sure you all know a thing or two about it. Last month, we started with the Egyptian section, and guess what? We're still at it. Two Sundays down, and we think we've only covered about a third of it. Who knows how many more Sundays it'll take to conquer this colossal museum.

Sometimes, wandering through the exhibits, I couldn't help but wonder how these folks managed to cart off so much from Egypt. Then again, similar practices were pretty common in India with invaders from Persia to London. 

>Anyway, nowadays, it's the stronger ones making off with oils and other natural resources from other countries. The more things change, the more they stay the same, huh?
