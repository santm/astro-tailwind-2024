## Day 4

On the fourth day of our adventure, we woke up with the first light of dawn, eager to explore the wonders that awaited us. Our destination for the morning was the enchanting **Bansankari Temple**. This sacred temple houses a magnificent eight-handed idol of the goddess, revered with great devotion. As we entered, our eyes were drawn to a remarkable sight: a lady gracefully circumambulating the temple with a wet cloth, a ritual symbolizing her recent bath in the nearby holy pond. Fortunately, the morning hour spared us from the usual crowds, allowing us to relish our darshan of the deity in tranquil serenity.

### Breakfast

After our spiritual journey, we returned to our hotel, patiently awaiting our breakfast, which arrived a tad later than expected, owing to our early start. Once packed, we set out on our next adventure to **Badami Caves**. These awe-inspiring caves, inspired by the Ellora Caves, comprise four distinct sanctuaries. Monkeys playfully roamed the base, particularly in **Cave 1**, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Note that carrying food or water bottles is discouraged within the caves. To enhance our experience, we engaged an experienced guide with two decades of cave expertise. His detailed explanations brought the ancient carvings to life, and we had ample time to capture the beauty in photographs. While the motifs were familiar from our previous stops in Hampi, Aihole, and Patadkal, the caves' rock-cut architecture ensured they remained in impeccable condition, sheltered from the natural decay.

### Bhutanatha Temple and More

Completing our exploration of the caves, we embarked on a daring drive through the bustling local market. At times, we found ourselves at a standstill, with no space to maneuver. Nevertheless, we eventually made it to the **Bhutanatha Temple**. On this occasion, Aarush chose to remain in the car, while we ventured swiftly through the temple's premises.

### Mahakuta Temple and Beyond

After checking out of our hotel, the staff suggested a stop at **Mahakuta Temple** before proceeding to Bijapur. This revered Shiva temple is known for its sacred pond, where devotees take a purifying dip. We spent a short  time here before resuming our journey towards Bijapur, forsaking lunch along the way.

### Exploring Bijapur

The afternoon sun blazed down on us as we pressed on toward Bijapur, covering a distance of 120 kilometers. Personally, I had reservations about skipping lunch in Badami, but we were determined to reach our destination. We settled at **Hotel Pearl** on Station Road, a basic accommodation choice without any prior recommendations. While some websites and friends had mentioned **Hotel Madhuvan**, we had only inquired about it from Bangalore. After a swift check-in, we wasted no time and embarked on our Bijapur adventure.

Our first stop was the captivating **Jod Gumbaz**, a twin tomb, followed by a visit to the historic **Ibrahim Rauza**. As we enthusiastically captured photographs, a knowledgeable guide approached us, offering his services for a comprehensive tour of the town's attractions. We gladly accepted and embarked on a town-wide tour, covering **Malik-e-Maidan** (the great cannon), **Barakaman**, **Jami Masjid**, **Taj Bawdi**, **Mehtar Mahal**, and **Asar Mahal**. The only major attraction left was the iconic **Gol Gumbaz**. Our guide shared its history and advised us to arrive early the next morning for an exceptional experience.

### Evening 

As the day drew to a close, our guide left us around 6 PM near **Barakaman**, where we, three tired and hungry adventurers, waited for a restaurant to open its doors at 7. Aarush, our resilient companion, made the most of the situation and enjoyed a meal.  After having  our food, headed back to the hotel. Unfortunately, there was no hot water available now as we found.

We ere told that it would be resume  by 4 AM. Was reallying looking for a hot bath after a long day ðŸ˜¥ otherwise it was a fun day.

Tomorrow we continue our journey through Bijapur.
