title: The Serene Forests of India
---

Starting from India's crown  
Lie the craggy white hills  
Dotted with pine, moss oak, and maple  
Who stand like sentinels  
Against the cold wind  
They never cry or frown  
From the ruthless wind  
  
On her left hand  
Of the west  
Lies an ecosystem of sand  
Lie plains of gold that shine during the day   
And the skies twinkle in the night  
Where the dry shrubs and cacti sway  
In the unbearable baking winds  
  
Greenery adorns her right hand  
Evergreen, moist, and conventional  
For a beautiful weather  
And every year the monsoon wind  
Rushes to kiss her hand  
  
The coastal forests  
Near the sea of arabia and the bay of Bengal  
Too remain fertile from the tropical wind  
Laden with moisture renew life in this part of India  
And animals of fur, feather and  
Leather comes to make these forests their cozy home  
May they be big as goliath or as small as gnomes  
  
For each forest you oath to visit, you must  
Life finds a way  
To give every creature a place to stay   
And the forests of India   
Was gods place of putting Eden  
On the earth's crust
