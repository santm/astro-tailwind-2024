title: Visit to Ram Krishna Mission
---

Ramkrishna Mission, also known as the center of Vedantic Society, is conveniently situated outside of Paris. It's a wonderful place to escape to and spend some peaceful time. Our first visit happened to coincide with Ramkrishna's birth anniversary. Navigating our way there was a bit uncertain, but a stroke of luck led us to someone who spoke English at the station, guiding us to the center.

In terms of size, this center is quite big compared to the ones we visited outside of India in California, namely San Francisco and Berkeley. If you're curious, you can check out their webpage for more information.

During our visit, we had the pleasure of meeting some delightful families who share our mother tongue. Surprisingly, they've been living here for more than 30 years, which was a bit of a shock to us. While I'm not entirely sold on the idea of settling here for the long term, it was genuinely nice to connect with some people.
