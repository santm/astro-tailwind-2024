This place which is most visited by tourist in Paris. I really did not
wanted to visit this one as I have been to Disney land twice in
California. Pamela wanted to visit this place last summer but some how I
was able to save myself from that trip. This year I could not escape.
OK, enough of cursing and all. At end I have to say, that I did enjoyed
my time there like every other time at Disneyland. We went with Asha,
she was studying French for 3 months that time in Paris at ***Alliance
Francais.*** As usual, she beat us on time, we were only 5 minutes late
this time at the Metro Station before starting for Disneyland. The day
was over-cast so it was not that warm as we expected in the morning. Our
day started with one of the roller coaster, which was not bad for me,
not enough for Pamela and it was first roller coaster for Asha. She was
doing OK after few minutes after that we waited long to see the **Loin
King Show**. It was nice. At evening, Asha left after few other rides of
roller coasters and late afternoon parade. We continued with dinner and
evening Parade and fireworks. This evening Parade was new for me. It was
very nicely done with lights and all. At the end Pamela agreed not to
visit this place soon so next might be --Â **Astrix Park**
