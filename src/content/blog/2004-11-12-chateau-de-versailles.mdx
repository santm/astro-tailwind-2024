I have a fascination for the colour of autumn, mat be the reason is I

never experienced them before while in India and California. You can

enjoy the same in Paris where trees along the big boulevards changes it

colour. Around Paris particularly the Bois de Boulogne is very nice that

time. We went to Versailles just to take pictures. It was not a very

sunny day that Sunday, sun was playing around clouds. But it was nice

for a Sunday afternoon.
