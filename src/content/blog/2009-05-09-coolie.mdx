These people in red shirts are commonly known as **“coolie”** or porters, who are commonly seen at Indian Railway Stations. They remind me of those childhood days when they were part of our vacation *(mass aviation is still in its infancy in India)*. They help carry the oversized luggage that Indian travelers often have, as Indian travelers are not as physically fit as Westerners to lift their own luggage. Coolies are not permanent employees of the railways but have a long and strong working relationship with them. They receive many benefits from the railways, such as medical support and schooling for their kids. The recruitment process is very complex, and I am not an expert to write about the details. What I know is that their badges can be transferred between family members, and the definition of family members is very vague. This often results in badges being auctioned for amounts ranging between **5,00,000 to 20,00,000 INR (10K-40K USD)**.

According to the railway rule book, their working wage is minimal, which is not enough for them to sustain themselves or their families. So, there is a little bit of negotiation between the coolies and the travelers. Most of the time, they are like a moving timetable of Indian railways. You can cross-check the platform number, coach position for your train, and they will guide you to the right place at the right time.

Going down memory lane, there is a famous [Mohmohan Desai's movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085361/) by the same name, acted by none other than **Amitabh Bachchan** in Hindi in the '80s. The movie is very close to Bachchan fans as he had a near-death situation while performing a stunt for it. The whole of India was gripped by this news, and the movie's release was eagerly anticipated by his fans.
