title: Trip to Amsterdam (June 7th-9th)
---
Our first European sojourn brought us to Amsterdam, a choice inspired by the allure of Van Gogh's art and the reputed warmth of Amsterdam's inhabitants. The city, though not as sprawling as Paris, offered a delightful respite with its unique charm, cleanliness, and friendly atmosphere. Following the advice of guidebooks, we discovered the Dutch knack for ingenious solutions to everyday problems, evident in the uncrowded streets and well-planned urban layout.

We arrived on a Saturday morning and embarked on our exploration with a visit to the Van Gogh Museum, followed by a leisurely stroll through the Albert Cuypmarkt. For lunch, we indulged in Surinamese delights and savored Indonesian flavors for dinner, a culinary journey reflecting the cultural diversity shaped by Dutch colonial history.

Sunday was dedicated to the Rijksmuseum, where unfortunately, the main section was closed due to asbestos concerns. Nevertheless, the museum showcased masterpieces by Rembrandt and other Dutch luminaries, offering reduced entry fees and a complimentary audio tour.

Embracing the local lifestyle, Monday saw us renting bikes for an extensive 3 to 4-hour ride, crisscrossing the south canal belt multiple times. Our gastronomic adventures continued with a delightful falafel lunch and a Nepalese dinner—arguably the best falafel I've ever tasted.

Alas, our splendid trip concluded on Tuesday morning, coinciding with the onset of a general strike in Paris—a recurring theme for two consecutive weeks.
