It was late in May as the days started to get longer and warmer we started to explore Paris more.

It was great that we just went there without any plan. Various kinds of musical instruments, played by young student musicians on different themes, filled the air. It's a nice spot for a free concert and music if you happen to be around Paris. We spent quite a long time enjoying the melodies. Unfortunately, we had to miss the final grand Jazz program since it was already around 9 PM.
