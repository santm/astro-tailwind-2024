Requested my brother to send me one I-pod from USA with Hitesh as he was
coming to Paris on a business trip. It was very nice to catch up with
Hitesh, Neetu and Simran after moving out of CA. 

We met them at their hotel in Latin quarter and had dinner with them. 

It was almost 2 in the morning when we returned home in the cold night of February. It was really fun catching up with old friends after a long time.
