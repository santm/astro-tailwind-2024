title: Moving to Apartment
---

Alright, so we've officially made the move to our own apartment. This whole week was a real whirlwind, super busy and hectic.

Monday kicked off with a surprise - turns out I had to check out of the hotel on the same day, news I didn't get beforehand. The hotel folks informed Pamela, but the telephone got disconnected in the chaos, making it a real mess. Now there is no way to communicate to her as we do not have mobile phones for each of us yet.

 I have to admit, HR practices here are the worst – yes, the absolute worst. I've never dealt with such a mess, not even back in my contracting days. It's like these HR folks think they're doing you a massive favor by hiring you. So, I put my foot down, said I'm not leaving the hotel. If needed, I'll pay from my pocket and wait for my shipment from the US. After some heated arguments, they finally said, "No problem, stay as long as you need."

Tuesday and Wednesday, I took a couple of days off from work, thinking I'd use the time to settle into my new place. The movers showed up on time and put in real hard work, lugging everything up to the third floor without a lift. I quickly realized the sofa is way too big for my place, and I'm scratching my head figuring out how to deal with this bulky behemoth. Lots of boxes to open and arrange, and we're giving it our best shot. Luckyly we had a personal ***cave*** or store room below our apartment which was quite big so asked movers to put all our big boxes along with cycles and other stuff to dump there for now.

Gotta give credit to Pamela – she's doing a fantastic job. In the midst of all this, we squeezed in a trip to grab curtains and other essentials from nearby stores.

But guess what? The weekend rolls in, and we're off to Darty, the electronic superstore, to order a fridge, washing machine, and whatnot. Ended up at IKEA on Sunday, hunting for some small furniture. Weekends, it seems, come with their own to-do list!
