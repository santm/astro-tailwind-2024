Recently, I made a significant upgrade in my gadget collection, transitioning from the K750 to the K790 camera phone. You can read more about it [here](http://blog.santm.com/2006/08/04/swiss-map-tgv-and-gizmo/). After careful consideration, the K790 stood out to me with its blend of affordable pricing and advanced features. Interestingly, I discovered that James Bond himself used the same phone in his [latest movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/). I wonder what additional gadgets [**Mr. Q**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)) equipped him with for the film.

## Capturing Moments on the Go

One of my primary motivations for this upgrade was the desire for a camera phone to easily capture special moments. I vividly recall spending $250 back in 2002 at [Fry’s](http://frys.com/) for a Handspring Camera module — a purchase that now seems almost prehistoric in comparison.

Here are some snapshots taken with the K790:

1. **General Post Office (GPO) Mumbai:**
   The first photo captures the majestic General Post Office in Mumbai, a true relic from British colonial times in Indian history. While the architecture, especially the "centenary hall," exudes a European charm with its large round center desk, one can't help but wish for better preservation of this historical gem.

2. **Newsstand Near My Office:**
   The second picture showcases a local newspaper stand near my office. A stark contrast to [Pamela’s picture](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/paris/monuments/presse) of a newsstand in Paris, offering a unique perspective on global newsstand aesthetics.

## Tech Tips and Recommendations

For fellow K790 owners, I recommend using [MyPhoneExplorer](http://www.fjsoft.at/en/), a user-friendly freeware for seamless syncing. It allows you to sync with [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/) for your address book, ensuring you're not tethered to Microsoft's ecosystem.

On a side note, I'm eagerly awaiting MMS settings from Hutch customer support to unlock internet access and other cool features on my phone. According to their SLA, this process might take up to 72 hours, and I find myself still in anticipation.
