title: 2016 Run Planning

As I restarted running and for the first time with a coach and running group the enthusiasm is high. But I also realized that running and timing was not my first thought. I found it overwhelming not my cup of coffee and I started to look up at different alternatives. 

The group season starts with TCS 10K, Hyderabad Half Marathon followed up Delhi Half and then finishing with Mumbai Full Marathon.
