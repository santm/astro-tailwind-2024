# Belgium Diaries: A Diamond Surprise in the Heart of Europe

While organizing our old travelogs, I stumbled upon a glaring omission—no post on **[Belgium](http://www.santm.com/gallery3/index.php/2003/brussels)**. A significant gap that merits attention, as this trip holds immense value for me. Let's rewind to the year 2003, a mere 2 ½ months into marriage, and a significant move from the US to Paris awaited us—a monumental change. Beyond the cultural shock, language barriers posed daily challenges and mingling with the locals became a complex task. Amidst all this, I lost the embedded stone from my wedding ring, a token from Santanu's family, making it unwearable. Yet, amusingly, people continued to address me as **Mademoiselle**, mistakenly considering Santanu to be my "mon ami," a title I secretly relished.

This loss triggered Santanu to suggest a replacement. Lacking any spare ornament, I casually proposed a *diamond ring*, a suggestion he readily accepted—surprisingly nonchalant compared to other married men. Surprisingly, this casual conversation took root in his heart.

During our first trip to Amsterdam, the topic resurfaced amidst the diamond shops, but indecision prevailed, and the matter was deferred, becoming a "raat gayi baat gayi" scenario.

One fine morning, while scrutinizing the accounts, I noticed an unaccounted withdrawal for a rail ticket—an unexpected surprise that Santanu had kept under wraps. On questioning, he hesitated before admitting it was a birthday surprise—a trip to Belgium.

That evening, upon his return from the office, he urged me to research Antwerp—specifically for diamonds. I was genuinely taken aback by the depth of his commitment. Thus, a one-night, two-day sojourn to Belgium was planned.

Our journey commenced with the affordable Thalys bullet train, departing early morning. Upon reaching Brussels, we checked into our pre-booked hotel and promptly set off for Antwerp, an hour's train ride away. Antwerp's diamond district, near the Central Station, is renowned for trading, cutting, and polishing diamonds. After perusing several stores, we finally made a purchase.

We then strolled towards downtown Antwerp, the lively heart of the city. The captivating *Grote Markt*, surrounded by the Town Hall and decorative guild houses from the 16th and 17th centuries, is a delightful square. After a day of exploration, we returned to Brussels.

In Brussels, we ventured to the magnificent central square, the **Grand Palace**, adorned with the country's finest baroque guildhalls, charming pavement cafes, and intimate restaurants. It was a hidden gem, revealed only as you entered the narrow side alleys surrounding the square. Dinner at a nearby Indian restaurant failed to impress the locals with its bland flavors.

### Day 2

The next day, our exploration of Brussels commenced with a visit to the **Atomium**, representing molecules with 9 atoms. This colossal structure comprises 9 interconnected spheres accessible by escalators.

*Tip: Worth it only for a panoramic view of Brussels.*

Adjacent to it lies **Mini Europe**, featuring models of the main highlights of European countries. As we already had plans to explore other European countries during our stay in Paris, we opted to skip this attraction.

Our next stop was the Comic Strip Art Museum, home to famous characters like **Tintin** and the Smurfs. Santanu, an admirer of Tintin, spent considerable time exploring the exhibits. Subsequently, we strolled towards **Galeries St Hubert**, a charming arcade lined with cafes, theaters, and luxury stores, featuring a gorgeous glass roof—a must-see for first-time European travelers.

>*Tip: If shopping is on your agenda, remember that Brussels is renowned for lace boutiques and chocolates.*

For us, the shopping had reached its limit; it was time to pack up. I wish there were a way to express my gratitude to my beloved husband for this trip and the extravagant gift—a perfect celebration that I continue to cherish, even after four years.
