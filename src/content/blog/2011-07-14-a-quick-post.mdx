I find reading old newspaper clippings fascinating. An article that occupied a significant space on its day of publication, likely read and forgotten by many. And here I am, reading it after days, with a fresh perspective. Most times, these articles turn out to be great stories to read with eagerness.

One that caught my eye today is "[Chaturanan Mishra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanan_Mishra "C Mishra") passed away." Several things compelled me to write this quick post. Firstly, the surname, which is very similar to mine, but the name itself is truly intriguing. I'm quite sure no parent in the 21st century would choose this name for their boys, for various reasons.

The actual meaning of this name is a person with four faces, which refers to Brahma, the creator of the universe.

It should not be confused with "Chatur," where a quick English translation would be a "smart person." However, over the years, the base word "chatur" has taken on the connotation of the dark side of smartness, often associated with mischievous acts that may lead to traps for those not so "chatur." The last reason is, of course, the blockbuster movie starring Aamir Khan, "[3 Idiots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots "3 - Idiots"). The memories it evokes are enough to discourage choosing this name, considering the multitude of other names available.

This is a humble tribute to Chaturanan Misra. He was a freedom fighter from Madhuvan in Bihar and was imprisoned by the British. After independence, he served in both state and national legislatures and worked for agricultural reform and farmers. The northern part of Madhuvan in Bihar is known for its natural color paintings with a unique style. Some consider Maithili (the local dialect) as very soft and poetic.
